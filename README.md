### Test features

This features allows to test the clock in different ways.

- Time (`?time=23:06`): get the quotes for a particular time ([link](https://literatureclock.netlify.app/?time=12:30))
- Quote (`?quote=My awesome quote`): test a quote before submit it ([link](https://literatureclock.netlify.app/?quote=Hi%20mom!%20I%27m%20part%20of%20the%20Literature%20Clock!)). You don't need to escape the quote by adding the special characters, just write the quote and the browser will add them.

## Languages

All translations were made from the original English file, which means that they have errors, sometimes the translation it's not accurate (I used Google Translate, yes, I know), sometimes the time is not highlighed properly, but it's fine, this is something that can be fixed easily, just one quote at a time. Plus, I marked all the *bad* quotes with an astherisk so at some point all of them will be fixed.
