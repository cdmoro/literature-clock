"While they were drinking at the fountain, church clocks began to strike <-<-<-<midnight>->->->. Missis said gladly, “Oh, Pongo, it’s tomorrow! Now we shall be with our puppies today!”"
"At <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> the entrances were thrown wide, and the rabble, surging in, occupied the quarters assigned to them, from which nothing less than an earthquake or an army with spears could have dislodged them. They dozed the night away on the benches, and breakfasted there; and there the close of the exercises found them, patient and sight-hungry as in the beginning."
"“I thought you asleep,” he said, presently.<br>“Sleep is for old people and little children, and I came out to look at my friends, the stars in the south—those now holding the curtains of <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> over the Nile. But confess yourself surprised!”"
"Ren said, ""If you go to the football field at <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> on Halloween and say his name three times, his ghost is supposed to appear."""
"You, Willi, my friend, said Pastor Fritz softly, ""you who sit in <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> darkness at midday, is this Jesus Christ a horn of salvation, a light in your darkness?"""
"You take a black cat---isn't that it?---that does not have even one white hair (you know this), and you bind his four paws, and then you take him at <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> to a crossroads and you cry out in a loud voice:"
"And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to the shore where a man sat, wakeful at <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, to receive you."
"If Jill had been more used to adventures, she might have doubted the Owl’s word, but this never occurred to her; and in the exciting idea of a <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> escape she forgot her sleepiness."
"“And almost exactly at <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, the Count’s patience was rewarded. For in accordance with the instructions he’d written to Richard, every telephone on the first floor of the Metropol began to ring.”"
“Wins Sibby damn it!” Mr. Hubert said. “Wins Sibby! What the hell else are we setting up till <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> arguing about?”
"<-<-<-<Midnight>->->->, and there was frost on the fields and patches of black ice on a road notorious for its accidents—there were bunches of dead flowers tied to fence posts and telegraph poles, and torn gaps in hedges, like some kind of failed crop."
"The Place St. Sulpice, so quiet and deserted, where toward <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> there came every night the woman with the busted umbrella and the crazy veil. Every night she slept there on a bench under her torn umbrella, the ribs hanging down, her dress turning green, her bony fingers and the odor of decay oozing from her body; and in the morning I’d be sitting there myself, taking a quiet snooze in the sunshine, cursing the god-damned pigeons gathering up the crumbs everywhere."
"The house is empty, but Eugene sings as if he had for audience all the crowned heads of Europe. The garden door is open and the odor of wet leaves sops in and the rain blends with Eugene’s <em>angoisse</em> and <em>tristesse</em>. At <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, after the spectators have saturated the hall with perspiration and foul breaths, I return to sleep on a bench. The exit light, swimming in a halo of tobacco smoke, sheds a faint light on the lower corner of the asbestos curtain; I close my eyes every night on an artificial eye ..."
"Trevor had on an Andy Warhol costume: blond bobbed wig, thick black glasses, tight striped shirt. My first impression of him was that he was free spirited, clever, funny. That proved to be completely inaccurate. We left the party together and walked around for hours, lied to each other about our happy lives, ate pizza at <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, took the Staten Island Ferry back and forth and watched the sun rise."
"J. Came to my bed at <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, and during our athletics, my door was barged. Farcical horror! Thank God J. had locked it on her way in. The doorknob rattled, insistent knocking began. Fear can clear the mind as well as cloud it, and remembering my <em>Don Juan</em>, I hid J. in a nest of coverlets and sheets in my sagging bed and left the curtain half open to show I had nothing to hide."
"It was an animal thing. A wilderness thing. Nothing about her belonged to her previous self in that moment. Above all her voice. This could have been the high shriek of a hawk, the soul-haunting howl of a wolf, the rasping cry of a red fox at <-<-<-<midnight>->->->. It could have been any of them, but not the scream of a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl."
"Oliver Dubois rammed a pickup truck through his front door on a sweaty <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> in July, at the tail end of a massive block party.<br>It wasn’t his truck, and the street was closed to traffic, so the vehicle’s emergence out of darkness and slow rumble up Oak Drive scattered neighbors and guests alike into confused groups on candlelit lawns."

"Here before me was a vast sweep of empty space: just the closed door and me, and only the stars sprinkled across the <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> sky to see what I did next. Did those cold, distant lights watch with any vestige of the humans they had once been, those special, chosen, favored ones who had brushed to close to the divine?"
"Had the lure of blood and ecstasy in the <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> woods brought her sailing over the glittering blue waters? I wondered why she was here now, in the vineyard."

"At <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, the lights in the café’s kitchen could be particularly harsh. Without the comfort of the daylight streaming in through the stained-glass window, everything in the room looked grim and utilitarian."
Sometimes there is no darker place than our own thoughts; the moonless <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> of the mind.
“It starts at <-<-<-<midnight>->->->.”
Dawn seemed to follow <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> with indecent haste.
"“I shall never forget his flying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at <-<-<-<twelve o’clock>->->-> at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”"
"On the night after his ride to Lawrenceville a crowd sallied to New York in quest of adventure, and started back to Princeton about <-<-<-<twelve o’clock>->->-> in two machines. It had been a gay party and different stages of sobriety were represented."

"But wait till I tell you, he said. ""We had a <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before."""
"Midnight, you said. What is <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> to the young? And suddenly a festive blaze was flung Across five cedar trunks, snow patches showed, And a patrol car on our bumpy road Came to a crunching stop. Retake, retake!"
"That a man who could hardly see anything more than two feet away from him could be employed as a security guard suggested to me that our job was not to secure anything but to report for work every night, fill the bulky ledger with cryptic remarks like 'Patrolled perimeter <-<-<-<12.00>->->-> pm, No Incident' and go to the office every fortnight for our wages and listen to the talkative Ms Elgassier."
"'Tis the year's <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, and it is the day's, Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks; The sun is spent, and now his flasks Send forth light squibs, no constant rays;"
"At <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> his wife and daughter might still be bustling about, preparing holiday delicacies in the kitchen, straightening up the house, or perhaps getting their kimonos ready or arranging flowers. Oki would sit in the living room and listen to the radio. As the bells rang he would look back at the departing year. He always found it a moving experience."
"Bernardo: 'Tis now struck <-<-<-<twelve>->->->; get thee to bed, Francisco."
"But, odder still - Big Ben had once again struck <-<-<-<midnight>->->->. The time outside still corresponded to that registered by the stopped gilt clock, inside. Inside and outside matched exactly, but both were badly wrong. H'm."
"But in the end I understood this language. I understood it, I understood it, all wrong perhaps. That is not what matters. It told me to write the report. Does this mean I am freer now than I was? I do not know. I shall learn. Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is <-<-<-<midnight>->->->. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining."
"Cartridges not allowed after <-<-<-<0000h.>->->->, to encourage sleep."
"Gately can hear the horns and raised voices and u-turn squeals way down below on Wash. That indicates it's around <-<-<-<0000h.>->->->, the switching hour."
"Hamlet: What hour now? Horatio: I think it lacks of <-<-<-<twelve>->->->. Marcellus: No, it is struck."
"He is certain he heard footsteps: they come nearer, and then die away. The ray of light beneath his door is extinguished. It is <-<-<-<midnight>->->->; some one has turned out the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring him any help."
I am conceived to the chimes of <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> on the clock on the mantelpiece in the room across the hall. The clock once belonged to my great-grandmother (a woman called Alice) and its tired chime counts me into the world.
"I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass. 'There's nobody here!' I insisted. 'It was YOURSELF, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while since.' 'Myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking <-<-<-<twelve>->->->! It's true, then! that's dreadful!'"
"I was born in the city of Bombay . . . On the stroke of <-<-<-<midnight>->->->, as a matter of fact. Clock-hands joined palms in respectful greeting as I came. Oh, spell it out, spell it out: at the precise instant of India's arrival at independence, I tumbled forth into the world."
It is <-<-<-<midnight>->->->. The rain is beating on the windows. I am calm. All is sleeping. Nevertheless I get up and go to my desk. I can't sleep.
"Midnight had come upon the crowded city. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse; the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness; the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child - <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> was upon them all."
"Once upon a <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> dreary,<br>while I pondered weak and weary,<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>""Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door - Only this, and nothing more."""
"The clock striketh <-<-<-<twelve>->->-> O it strikes, it strikes! Now body, turn to air, Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell. O soul, be changed into little water drops, And fall into the ocean, ne'er to be found. My God, my God, look not so fierce on me!"
"The first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle Toby up stairs, which was about 10 - Mrs. Wadman threw herself into her arm chair, and crossing her left knee with her right, which formed a resting-place for her elbow, she reclin'd her cheek upon the palm of her hand, and leaning forwards, ruminated until <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> upon both sides of the question."
"To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed an believe) on a Friday, at <-<-<-<twelve o'clock>->->-> at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously."
We have heard the chimes at <-<-<-<midnight>->->->.
"It was surely <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> by now. A lone bird called, and the individual trees melted together in one forbidding and unfriendly mass. To Savonius they seemed to incarnate this dismal adventure which had been thrust on him against his will. Somewhere in this deep forest lay this demented man he was supposed to try to comfort and calm."
There was the <-<-<-<midnight>->->-> hike with the boys to the end of the promenade and the big argument about the election of a housemaster. What had become of responsibility and service? And brotherly love?

"She was wearing a watch. Not a digital one, in this life. An elegant, slender analogue one, with Roman numerals. It was about <-<-<-<a minute after midnight>->->->.<br>How is this happening?"
"With the appointed execution time of <-<-<-<one minute past midnight>->->-> just seconds away, I knocked on the metal door twice. The lock turned and the door swiftly swung open."
"And on all sides there were the clocks. Conrad noticed them immediately, at every street corner, over every archway, three quarters of the way up the sides of buildings, covering every conceivable angle of approach. Most of them were too high off the ground to be reached by anything less than a fireman's ladder and still retained their hands. All registered the same time: 12:01. Conrad looked at his wristwatch, noted that it was just 2:45.<br>""They were driven by a master dock,"" Stacey told him. ""When that stopped, they all ceased at the same moment. <-<-<-<One minute after midnight>->->->, thirty-seven years ago."""
At <-<-<-<two minutes past twelve>->->-> the door opens and two men come into the lobby. One is tall with black hair combed in a 50’s pompadour. The other is short and bespectacled. Both are wearing suits.

"It was just <-<-<-<three minutes past midnight>->->-> when I last saw Archer Harrison alive. I remember, because I said it was two minutes past and he looked at his watch and said it was three minutes past."
"Suddenly I felt a great stillness in the air, then a snapping of tension. I glanced at my watch. <-<-<-<Three minutes after midnight.>->->-> I was breathing normally and my pen moved freely across the page. Whatever stalked me wasn’t quite as clever as I’d feared, I thought, careful not to pause in my work."
"At <-<-<-<four minutes past twelve>->->->, Frank Macintosh and Paulie Logan enter the lobby dressed in their suits. There are handshakes all around. Frank’s pompadour appears to have had an oil change."
"At <-<-<-<four minutes past midnight>->->->, January 22, Admiral Lowry's armada of more than 250 ships reached the transport area off Anzio. The sea was calm, the night was black."
"It was <-<-<-<after twelve o'clock>->->-> when Easton came home. Ruth recognised his footsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop beating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had passed through."
"E.M. Security, normally so scrupulous with their fucking trucks at <-<-<-<0005h.>->->->, is nowhere around, lending weight to yet another cliché. If you asked Gately what he was feeling right this second he'd have no idea."
"At <-<-<-<six minutes past midnight>->->->, death relieved the sufferer."
"It was <-<-<-<seven minutes after midnight>->->->. The dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs. Shears's house. Its eyes were closed. It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream."
"Hour of the night! exclaimed the priest; ""it is day, not night, and the hour is <-<-<-<eight past midnight>->->->!"""

"Munster tells me that it was in the display case when he locked up last night. That was at <-<-<-<ten minutes past midnight>->->->. He unlocked this morning shortly after six but didn't look at the display case, although he thinks that he might have noticed if the arm had gone. But he can't be sure."
"It was at <-<-<-<ten minutes past midnight>->->->. Three police cars, Alsations and a black maria arrive at the farmhouse. The farmer clad only in a jock-strap, refused them entry."
At <-<-<-<ten minutes past midnight>->->-> a call was made to the police by Garry Ashe from his aunt's house to say that he had returned from a walk to discover her body.
"She was to leave the reception as soon as she could and return to her room to change clothes. At <-<-<-<12:11>->->-> there'd be another blackout, during which she'd take the outside stairwell to the ground floor and wait at the exit for a Broadmoor's catering van."
"The first incendiaries to hit St Thomas's Hospital had splattered Riddell House at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past midnight>->->->, from where a few hours earlier the Archbishop of Canterbury had given 'an inspiring address'."

It was <-<-<-<twelve minutes past midnight>->->-> when mother and daughter saw the first lightning strike. It hit the main barn with such force the ground trembled under their feet.
"It's <-<-<-<thirteen minutes past midnight>->->->. We're on yet another plane, this time from San Diego To Boston via Chicago. All around me people are sleeping."
It was exactly <-<-<-<fourteen minutes past midnight>->->-> when he completed the final call. Among the men he had reached were honourable men. Their voices would be heard by the President.
"At <-<-<-<twelve-fifteen>->->-> he got out of the van. He tucked the pistol under the waistband of his trousers and crossed the silent, deserted street to the Hudston house."
"The party broke up after supper about a <-<-<-<quarter past twelve>->->->. Seeing her visitors off, Olga Mihalovna stood at the door and said:<br>""You really ought to take a shawl! It's turning a little chilly. Please God, you don't catch cold!"""
"At <-<-<-<sixteen minutes past midnight>->->->, Block 4 was hit and the roof set alight."
"So you deduce that I arrived at the fallen tree later than <-<-<-<twelve seventeen a.m.>->->-> It may have been so. As I wasn't concocting an alibi, I didn't check the time every two minutes."
"Kava ordered two glasses of coffee for himself and his beloved and some cake. When the pair left, exactly <-<-<-<seventeen minutes after twelve>->->->, the club began to buzz with excitement."
"Instantaneously the oblong became a square; then that, too, was extinguished. Toynton Grange lay, a faintly discerned shape etched in the darkness on the silent headland. Curious, he looked at his watch. The time was <-<-<-<eighteen minutes past midnight>->->->."
"21st December 1985, <-<-<-<12:18 a.m.>->->-><br>[IN BED]<br>Michael doesn’t believe in Heaven or Hell. He’s got closer to death than most living people and he tells me there was no tunnel of light or dancing angels. I’m a bit disappointed, to be honest."
"I leaped out of bed, ran down the stairs and into the kitchen through that harsh, searing light. The clock on the wall was showing <-<-<-<nineteen minutes past midnight>->->->. I grabbed my black raincoat from the hook by the back door, pulled on my wellington boots, one of which was almost impossible to get my foot into, and rushed outside."
"When the police arrived at <-<-<-<twelve-twenty>->->-> they found Mrs. O'Keefe lying on a single divan in her front sitting-room, practically naked."
"“But by the time he reached the top of the hill the woman’s body had basically been eaten up already by the flies, right?” my friend said.<br>“In a sense,” his girlfriend replied.<br>“In a sense being eaten by the flies makes it a sad story, doesn’t it?” my friend said.<br>“Yes, I guess so,” she said after giving it some thought. “What do you think?” she asked me.<br>“Sounds like a sad story to me,” I replied.<br>It was <-<-<-<twelve twenty>->->-> when my cousin came back."
"Now she was kneading the little ball of hot paste on the convex margin of the bowl and I could smell the opium. There is no smell like it. Beside the bed the alarm-clock showed <-<-<-<twelve-twenty>->->->, but already my tension was over. Pyle had diminished."
"The aircraft took off at <-<-<-<12:21>->->->, and while the rest of the family dozed, Sasha went over the speech he would deliver on arrival at the airport. He also needed to prepare a eulogy for his uncle’s funeral, but that would have to wait until they checked into their hotel."
"<-<-<-<12:21 A.M.>->->-><br>Uh-oh. Vance felt the tracks suddenly shiver. Then with what sounded like a painful grind of metal on metal, the gantry started moving again. They'd decided to override the safety shutoff."
"Nobody had been one of Mycroft Ward's most important operatives and for sixty seconds every day, between <-<-<-<12.21 am>->->-> and 12.22 am., his laptop was permitted to connect directly with the gigantic online database of self that was Mycroft Ward's mind."

"Oskar weighed the wristwatch in his hand, then gave the rather fine piece with its luminous dial showing <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes past midnight>->->-> to little Pinchcoal.

"Sanders with Sutton as his gunner began their patrol at <-<-<-<12.24 am>->->->, turning south towards Beachy Head at 10,000 ft."
"After a moment reality reasserted itself, and she realized she hadn't been hallucinating, but dreaming. The clock on the desk read 12:55. They'd begun their ten-minute session at <-<-<-<12:25>->->->, so obviously she had twenty minutes to account for."
"Charlotte remembered that she had heard Gregoire go downstairs again, almost immediately after entering his bedroom, and before the servants had even bolted the house-doors for the night. He had certainly rushed off to join Therese in some coppice, whence they must have hurried away to Vieux-Bourg station which the last train to Paris quitted at <-<-<-<five-and-twenty minutes past midnight>->->->. And it was indeed this which had taken place."
"I mean, look at the time! <-<-<-<Twenty-five past midnight>->->->! It was a triumph, it really was!"
A Mr. Dutta from King's Cross called and told me you were on your way. He said you wanted to see the arrival of yesterday's <-<-<-<12.26 am>->->->. It'll take me a few minutes to cue up the footage. Our regular security bloke isn't here today; he's up before Haringey Magistrates' Court for gross indecency outside the headquarters of the Dagenham Girl Pipers.
Blake came off the bus behind a pudgy woman carrying a sleeping baby in her arms. The bus driver was talking to a flashy little twist He didn’t even turn to look at the woman and her baby.

"What time is it? asked Teeny-bits.<br>The station agent hauled out his big silver watch, looked at it critically and announced: ""<-<-<-<Twenty-nine minutes past twelve>->->->.”<br>“Past twelve!"" repeated Teeny-bits. ""It can't be."""
"<-<-<-<Half-past twelve o’clock>->->-> came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his inkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into quietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall reveries."

"It was <-<-<-<half-past twelve>->->-> when I returned to the Albany as a last desperate resort. The scene of my disaster was much as I had left it. The baccarat-counters still strewed the table, with the empty glasses and the loaded ash-trays. A window had been opened to let the smoke out, and was letting in the fog instead."
"Third individual approaches unnoticed and without caution. Once within reach, individual reaches out toward subjects. Recording terminates: timecode: <-<-<-<00:31>->->->:02."
"Meticulously he noted the time by the wall clock over the fireplace and made a record in his book. ""<-<-<-<12:32>->->-> Mr. Courtney-Brigs reports fallen tree across the Winchester Road path."""
"<-<-<-<Thirty-two minutes past midnight>->->->; the way things were going I could be at it all night. Before beginning a completely new search of the dial I had a thought: maybe this safe didn't open on zero as older models did, but on a factory-set number."
Stephen Maxie looked him straight in the eye and said almost casually: “It was <-<-<-<thirty-three minutes past twelve>->->-> by my watch.
"<-<-<-<Thirty-four minutes past midnight>->->->. 'We got ten minutes to be back here.' LT didn't argue. Schoolboy knew his former trade. LT's eyes fretted over the museum. 'Not still worrying about the security, are you, because there ain't none.'"
Mrs. Gentrie looked at the clock. It was <-<-<-<thirty-five minutes past midnight>->->->.
The clock read <-<-<-<thirty-five minutes past midnight>->->->. I was dazed from the deepness of the sleep. Who could be calling me at this hour?
The prosecutor looked at her gold watch. <-<-<-<Thirty-six minutes past midnight>->->->.

"Stephen looked at his bedside clock. <-<-<-<12:37 AM>->->->.<br>He went into the kitchen, and grabbed a Vanilla Coke from the refrigerator. In the living room, he opened the DVD cabinet, and ran his eyes across the hundreds of titles."
You left the main hospital building at about midnight. You spoke to the porter at the main gate at <-<-<-<twelve thirty-eight a.m.>->->-> Where were you between those times?
"Somewhere he'd lost three days; for he'd entered the burning veil Thursday, <-<-<-<thirty-eight minutes past midnight>->->->. Yes. But keep cool. There's more at stake than three lost days. There must be; otherwise why the police?"

"He looked around the carriage he was sitting in. It was full of night people, waiters, nurses, party returners, drunks—even a traffic warden. The train eventually pulled into his station at <-<-<-<twelve-forty>->->->."
It was the opinion of the forensic pathologist who saw the body at <-<-<-<twelve-forty>->->-> that Mrs. O'Keefe had died very shortly after her return home.

"By the time he came back to his car, it was <-<-<-<12:41 am>->->->. I was standing outside my car, just waiting and he noticed me."
"The butt had been growing warm in her fingers; now the glowing end stung her skin. She crushed the cigarette out and stood, brushing ash from her black skirt. It was <-<-<-<eighteen minutes to one>->->->. She went to the house phone and called his room. The telephone rang and rang, but there was no answer."
"Died five minutes ago, you say? he asked. His eye went to the watch on his wrist. <-<-<-<Twelve-forty-three>->->->, he wrote on the blotter."
It was <-<-<-<12:44 A.M.>->->-> when she turned the corner by Brulee's onto Stateline Road. She waited on the approaching train.
"It was a banging shutter somewhere below that woke me. I picked my watch up from the night table and saw it was <-<-<-<quarter of one>->->->. I didn’t think there was going to be any more sleep for me until that banging stopped, so I got dressed, started out the door, then returned to the closet for my slicker. When I got downstairs, I paused. From the big bedroom down the hall from the parlor, I could hear Mrs. S sawing wood in long, noisy strokes. No banging shutter was going to break her rest."
"At <-<-<-<12.45>->->->, during a lull, Mr. Yoshogi told me that owing to the war there were now many more women in England than men."
"At the thought he jumped to his feet and took down from its hook the coat in which he had left Miss Viner's letter. The clock marked the <-<-<-<third quarter after midnight>->->->, and he knew it would make no difference if he went down to the post-box now or early the next morning; but he wanted to clear his conscience, and having found the letter he went to the door."
Teddy wrote that phone records confirm Miss Lutton's story. She called at <-<-<-<12:46 a.m.>->->->
"At <-<-<-<12:47 a.m>->->->, Uncle Ho left us forever."
"Stanton shut the light off, glancing quickly at the clock's red numerals; it was <-<-<-<12:48 a.m.>->->-> She tried to remember what day it was."
That's when they began yelling for help. A security guard at a nearby high-rise heard their cries and called police. It was <-<-<-<12:49 A.M.>->->-> Metro-Dade Officer Bart Cohen and his partner arrived one minute later.
"The packing was done at <-<-<-<12.50>->->->; and Harris sat on the big hamper, and said he hoped nothing would be found broken. George said that if anything was broken it was broken, which reflection seemed to comfort him. He also said he was ready for bed."
My smile suddenly vanished after realizing the time. It was <-<-<-<12:51>->->-> and at one in the morning usually checks us. I tried to run as fast as I could to reach the elevator until I did.
"New Year’s Eve night, well, way early New Year's morning, 1998<br>Let’s be exact: Let’s say it was <-<-<-<12:52 a.m.>->->-><br>I discovered what I want:<br>Attention."
"But he came out of it so slowly this time that Jacqueline had already picked up the phone and said hello before he was fully awake. The clock said it was <-<-<-<12:53 A.M.>->->-> A bit early for Meade to call, yet who else could it be?"
"Everybody was happy; everybody was complimentary; the ice was soon broken; songs, anecdotes, and more drinks followed, and the pregnant minutes flew. At <-<-<-<six minutes to one>->->->, when the jollity was at its highest— BOOM! There was silence instantly."
"After a moment reality reasserted itself, and she realized she hadn't been hallucinating, but dreaming. The clock on the desk read <-<-<-<12:55>->->->. They'd begun their ten-minute session at 12:25, so obviously she had twenty minutes to account for."
"At <-<-<-<five minutes to one>->->->, the host of the show emerged from a heated tent to massive applause from the crowd. She was dressed in a fuchsia coat, with a black turtleneck, a knee-length skirt, black tights, and knee-high boots."
"He rolled one way, rolled the other, listened to the loud tick of the clock, and was asleep a minute later. <-<-<-<Five to one>->->-> in the morning. Fifty-one hours to go."
"At <-<-<-<twelve fifty-six A.M.>->->->, Jo O'Connor finally gave up on the idea of sleep. For hours she'd been awake worrying about Louis and Stormy and Sarah Two Knives. And about Cork."
It was <-<-<-<12:56 A.M.>->->-> when Gerald drove up onto the grass and pulled the limousine right next to the cemetery.
"Teacher used to lie awake at night facing that clock, batting his eyelashes against his pillowcase to mimic the sound of the rolling drop action. One night, and this first night is lost in the countless later nights of compounding wonder, he discovered a game. Say the time was <-<-<-<12:56>->->->."
"A minute had passed, and the roller dropped a new leaf. <-<-<-<12:57>->->->. 12 + 57 = 69; 6 + 9 = 15; 1 + 5 = 6. 712 + 5 = 717; 71 + 7 = 78; 7 + 8 = 15; 1 + 5 = 6 again."
"It was downright shameless on his part to come visiting them, especially at night, <-<-<-<almost at one in the morning>->->->, after all that had happened."
"<-<-<-<00:58 CET>->->-><br>""Everything's in place. Now all we have to do is. . .""<br>William didn't move a muscle until the voice faded away. More words, but they were scattered in the wind. He raised the tarpaulin an inch, and his eyes settled on a group of four men standing only a few yards from the lifeboat."
"Only the hoot of a belated car faintly disturbed the silence.<br>I looked at my wrist-watch. This showed <-<-<-<one minute to one>->->->. As I raised my eyes, an impatient clock somewhere confirmed its tale.<br>With a yawn I conjured the terrier to go to sleep and reached for the switch.<br>As I did so, he growled again."
"What time is it now? she said.<br>""<-<-<-<About one o’clock>->->->.""<br>""In the morning?""<br>Herera’s friend leered at her. ""No, there’s a total eclipse of the sun."""
"It was <-<-<-<nearly one o’clock>->->-> when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures."
"I looked attentively at her, as she put that singular question to me. It was then <-<-<-<nearly one o'clock>->->->. All I could discern distinctly by the moonlight was a colourless, youthful face, meagre and sharp to look at about the cheeks and chin; large, grave, wistfully attentive eyes; nervous, uncertain lips; and light hair of a pale, brownish-yellow hue."
"If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon is in some ways a better time to try than the middle of the night. Doors and windows are more likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren’t meaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants or grown-ups believe this if you’re found climbing out of a bedroom window at <-<-<-<one o’clock in the morning>->->->.)"
"He shut down at <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->->. He had written two pages, and the feeling that he was reverting to the nervous and neurotic man who’d almost burned down his house three years ago was getting harder to dismiss."
"Shortly before <-<-<-<1 a.m.>->->->, he answered a knock at the back door and admitted five men, two of whom were expert carpenters."
"I want to shout and scream, but I would be screaming at a wall. I storm off to my bedroom. Thirty minutes later, she leaves the house with Gboyega.<br>She doesn’t return till <-<-<-<1 a.m.>->->-><br>I don’t sleep till 1 a.m."
"It was <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->-> when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade"
"“Nobody noticed that he got off the ride without his date?”<br>“Nope. This was mid-July, the very height of the season, and the place was a swarming madhouse. They didn’t find the body until <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->-> the next morning, long after the park was closed and the Horror House work-lights were turned on. For the graveyard shift, you know.”"
"It was nearly <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->-> when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures."
"“Can’t do it, Findle; I’m with somebody else! Call me up to-morrow about <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->->!”"
"“About <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->-> they moved to Maxim’s, and two found them in Deviniere’s. Sloane had been drinking consecutively and was in a state of unsteady exhilaration, but Amory was quite tiresomely sober; they had run across none of those ancient, corrupt buyers of champagne who usually assisted their New York parties. """
The more he thought about it the more puzzled he was… He didn’t understand this revolver<br>business…<br>Somebody in the house had got that revolver…<br>Downstairs a clock <-<-<-<struck one>->->->.
<-<-<-<1.00 am.>->->-> I felt the surrounding quietness suffocating me.
"He didn’t know what was at the end of the chute. The opening was narrow (though large enough to take the canary). He dreamed that the chute opened onto vast garbage bins filled with old coffee filters, ravioli in tomato sauce and mangled genitalia. Huge worms, as big as the canary, armed with terrible beaks, would attack the body. Tear off the feet, rip out its intestines, burst the eyeballs. He woke up, trembling; it was only <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->->. He swallowed three Xanax. So ended his first night of freedom."
I'm the only one awake in this house on this night before the day that will change all our lives. Though it's already that day: the little luminous hands on my alarm clock (which I haven't set) show just gone <-<-<-<one in the morning>->->->.
"It was the thirtieth of May by now. <-<-<-<One am>->->-> on the thirtieth of May 1940. Quite a famous date on which to be lying awake and staring at the ceiling. Already in the creeks and tidal estuaries of England the pleasure-boats and paddle-steamers were casting their moorings for the day trip to Dunkirk. And, over on the other side, Ted stood as a good a chance as anyone else."
"Last night of all, When yon same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course t'illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, <-<-<-<The bell then beating one>->->->."
"The station was more crowded than he had expected to find it at - what was it? he looked up at the clock - <-<-<-<one o'clock in the morning>->->->. What in the name of God was he doing on King's Cross station at one o'clock in the morning, with no cigarette and no home that he could reasonably expect to get into without being hacked to death by a homicidal bird?"
"What time is it now? she said.<br>""<-<-<-<About one o’clock>->->->.""<br>""In the morning?""<br>Herera’s friend leered at her. ""No, there’s a total eclipse of the sun."""
"Thus it was that at <-<-<-<one minute past one o'clock>->->->, when a preternaturally self-respecting porter dispassionately ascertained that nothing more would be required of him till morning and shut himself out of her presence, the girl subsided upon the edge of a bed of such sybaritic character as amply to warrant the designation de luxe, and, flushed and trembling with excitement (now that she dared once again to be her natural self) and with all incredulity appropriate to the circumstances, stared at the young woman who blankly stared back from a long mirror framed in the door."
"Fallon approached the gat at <-<-<-<two minutes past one>->->->, his swagger evidence of his satisfaction at the turn of events."
"<-<-<-<A little after one o’clock in the morning>->->->, Perena Lewitz arrived at the airport and headed to the Lanea Willats. The spotlights seemed to exaggerate the vast bloated shape of the Q-series freighter."
"Cleveland handed it to Toronto at <-<-<-<01:03>->->-> EST; that's seven minutes ago. At the moment, Toronto Center reports the aircraft's position as near London, Ontario. I have more information - course, height, speed - if you want it."
"The electric timepiece on the roofs marked <-<-<-<four minutes past one>->->-> as they rattled past. What people were still awake were most of them inside the shining windows of the restaurants, and the big porters were leaning sleepily against the doorposts of their hostelries. In the cab Ralston wondered what the President would say if he could see him then, chasing all over the town after a young woman and her male escort."
"She had called twice during the twenty-four hours following the old bastard’s stroke, when it became obvious he was going to snuff it. The phone had not been answered either time.<br>She called again after her father died — this time at <-<-<-<1:04>->->-> on the morning of August 2nd. Some drunk had answered the telephone."
"Certain, sir. It was just <-<-<-<five minutes past one>->->-> when I drove into our mews.<br>""Now, then, be careful about this, Mountain. I want to know exactly what happened when you drove up to the house. Tell us in your own way.""<br>The coachman looked round amongst the listeners as if he were a little perplexed. ""Why, sir,"" he answered, turning back to Barthorpe, ""there was nothing happened!"""
"We had come out of church together after midnight service and had immediately seen the offending light, as had most of the congregation. And Bill, always punctillious, had looked at his watch. His call to the manor had been made at <-<-<-<six minutes past one>->->->."
"When he woke it was <-<-<-<1:06>->->-> by the digital clock on the bedside table. He lay there looking at the ceiling, the raw glare of the vaporlamp outside bathing the bedroom in a cold and bluish light. Like a winter moon."
"<-<-<-<01:07 GMT>->->-><br>Lamont could hear the sound of a car coming from behind him. Moments later a green Jaguar drove past and proceeded along the driveway, lights full on. It came to a halt outside the house."
"But the most striking difference was the time of day. Outside the basement windows, night had fallen. The streetlights were on and there was a full moon out.<br>“Whoa,” I heard myself whisper. I glanced at the digital alarm clock sitting on top of one of the bookshelves. Its glowing blue display said the local time was now <-<-<-<1:07 A.M.>->->->"
"It was <-<-<-<1.08 a.m.>->->-> but he had left the ball at the same time as I did, and had further to travel."
"My radio-alarm is glowing <-<-<-<01:08>->->-> when I hear footsteps on the stairs, the pause, the timid knock-knock-knock on my outer door."
"Wednesday <-<-<-<1:09 A.M.>->->-><br>""Darling, do you think they'll figure out it was a ruse?""<br>""Who knows."" He looked up from stoking the fireplace, where nothing but embers remained. ""Tanzan Mino may be a genius, but the rest of his Yakuza hoods are not exactly rocket scientists."""
"They made an unostentatious exit from their coach, finding themselves, when the express had rolled on into the west, upon a station platform in a foreign city at <-<-<-<nine minutes past one>->->-> o'clock in the morning - but at length without their shadow."
"The back door was unbolted, Sir, while Caldwell and Miss Makepiece checked the lights. That was at about <-<-<-<ten past one>->->->."
"It was at <-<-<-<ten minutes past one>->->-> by Bond’s watch when, at the high table, the whole pattern of play suddenly altered."
"February 26, Saturday - Richards went out <-<-<-<1.10 am>->->-> and found it clearing a bit, so we got under way as soon as possible, which was 2:10a.m."
"Declares one of the waiters was the worse for liquor, and that he was giving him a dressing down. Also that it was <-<-<-<nearer to one than half past>->->->."
I left my door ajar and at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past one>->->-> I heard Harvey walking across the living-room. There was a gurgling as he took a swig from one of the bottles on the trolley. He let himself out of the front door as quietly as he could. I watched him from the window; he was alone.
That was under the pastoral cone of silence. Maybe I'll be able to tell Jenn more at some point down the line. But not now.<br>He looked at the clock. It said <-<-<-<1:12 AM>->->->.
"It was <-<-<-<1.12 a.m.>->->-> when Father arrived at the police station. I did not see him until 1.28 a.m. but I knew he was there because I could hear him.<br>He was shouting, ""I want to see my son,"" and ""Why the hell is he locked up?"" and, ""Of course I'm bloody angry."""

"Sal is here, this is my old buddy from New Yor-r-k, this is his first night in Denver and it's absolutely necessary for me to take him out and fix him up with a girl.<br>""But what time will you be back?""<br>""It is now,"" (looking at his watch) ""exactly <-<-<-<one-fourteen>->->->."""
"A bit weak, thought Robin, but the best he could do at <-<-<-<1:15>->->-> in the morning.<br>“Sure it wasn’t some beautiful girl?” said Mary.<br>“I’m afraid Jim and Fred could hardly be described as beautiful, even by their loving wives.”"
"Emma fell into a deep sleep, to be jolted back to consciousness by the unfamiliar sound of a police siren blaring from the street below. Now she understood why the rooms on the upper floors were more expensive. She checked her watch. It was <-<-<-<1:15>->->->."
"I am sorry, therefore, as I have said, that I ever paid any attention to the footsteps. They began about a <-<-<-<quarter past one>->->-> o'clock in the morning, a rhythmic, quick-cadenced walking around the dining-room table."
Lily Chen always prepared an 'evening' snack for her husband to consume on his return at <-<-<-<1.15 am>->->->.

"Friday <-<-<-<1:17 A.M.>->->-><br>The room was cold. Just cold. That was the first thing he'd noticed when they shoved him in. It still was. For nine hours he'd been sitting on a hard, canvas-covered Soviet cot, shivering."
"At that moment (it was <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past one>->->-> in the morning) Lieutenant Bronsfield was preparing to leave the watch and return to his cabin, when his attention was attracted by a distant hissing noise."
The clocks stopped at <-<-<-<1:17>->->->. A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions. He got up and went to the window. What is it? she said. He didn't answer. He went into the bathroom and threw the lightswitch but the power was already gone. A dull rose glow in the windowglass. He dropped to one knee and raised the lever to stop the tub and then turned on both taps as far as they would go.
"It was Saturday night, or technically Sunday morning. It was <-<-<-<eighteen minutes past one>->->->."
"Go to bed before he comes in, she ordered herself for the umpteenth time. Still, she sat looking at the clock. The minute hand had shifted to <-<-<-<nineteen past one>->->-> and her nerves grew more on edge."
"I woke up and glanced at my watch on the table next to my bed. It was <-<-<-<one twenty>->->->. My heart was beating furiously. I slid off the bed down onto the carpet, sat cross-legged, and took some deep breaths. Then I held my breath, relaxed my shoulders, sat up straight, and tried to focus. I must have swum too much, I decided, or got too much sun."
"Well! she said, looking like a minor female prophet about to curse the sins of the people. ""May I trespass on your valuable time long enough to ask what in the name of everything bloodsome you think you're playing at, young piefaced Bertie?

"Then it was <-<-<-<1.20 a.m.>->->->, but I hadn't heard Father come upstairs to bed. I wondered if he was asleep downstairs or whether he was waiting to come in and kill me. So I got out my Swiss Army Knife and opened the saw blade so that I could defend myself."
"Friday <-<-<-<1:21 A.M.>->->-><br>""Your name Vance?"" The Russian voice, with its uncertain English, was the last thing he'd expected.<br>""Who are you?""<br>""For this vehicle, I am Director Propulsion System,"" he replied formally, and with pride, pulling at his white lab coat. ""I must talk you. Please."""

"Larkin had died at <-<-<-<1.24 am>->->->, turning to the nurse who was with him, squeezing her hand, and saying faintly, 'I am going to the inevitable.'"

He exited the men's room at <-<-<-<one-twenty-nine A.M.>->->->
"She glanced at her bedside clock. <-<-<-<One thirty>->->->. Beneath the hands, tiny ivory-inlaid sheep jumped over a stile. Papa had designed it for her and she found herself counting the creatures now, trying to ignore the whirr of her mind as she closed her eyes and drifted off into an uneasy sleep full of silver-eyed men and skull-topped canes."
"Rose continued her meditations until <-<-<-<one thirty>->->-> that Monday morning. The rest of the True (with the exception of Apron Annie and Big Mo, currently watching over Grampa Flick) were sleeping deeply when she decided she was ready."
"The following day, at <-<-<-<one-thirty>->->->, I call on Van Norden. It’s his day off, or rather his night off. He has left work with Carl that I am to help him move today.<br>I find him in a state of unusual depression. He hasn’t slept a wink all night, he tells me. There’s something on his mind, something that’s eating him up."
"<-<-<-<Half-past one>->->->, The street lamp sputtered, The street lamp muttered, The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman ..."""
"Around <-<-<-<1:30 A.M.>->->-> the door opened and I thought it was Karla, but it was Bug, saying Karla and Laura had gone out for a stag night after they ran out of paint."
"The late hour helped. It simplified things. It categorized the population. Innocent bystanders were mostly home in bed. I walked for half an hour, but nothing happened. Until <-<-<-<one thirty>->->-> in the morning. Until I looped around to 22nd and Broadway."
"The radio alarm clock glowed <-<-<-<1:30 a.m.>->->-> Bad karaoke throbbed through walls. I was wide awake, straightjacketed by my sweaty sheets. A headache dug its thumbs into my temples. My gut pulsed with gamma interference: I lurched to the toilet."
It was <-<-<-<one-thirty-one>->->-> in the morning. He poured another Crown. Downed it and repeated the process two more times.
"I sat down on the couch again and looked at my watch It was <-<-<-<one thirty-two>->->->. I shut my eyes and focused on a spot in my head. My mind a total blank, I gave myself up to the sands of time and let the flow take me wherever it wanted."
"She grinned at him with malicious playfulness, showing great square teeth, and then ran for the stairs. <-<-<-<One-thirty-two>->->->. She thought that she heard a whistle blown and took the last three steps in one stride."
He looked at his watch. <-<-<-<One-thirty-three a.m.>->->-> He had been asleep on this bench for over an hour and a half.
"Myrtle couldn't sleep. Her digital clock's luminous numbers told her it was <-<-<-<01:34>->->-> in the morning, which would be later than she had ever been awake in her life. But the questions were so many, and so insistent, that they just wouldn't let her go."
"Two days later, the chime of his diary woke Merral in the middle of the night. He shook himself and peered at the clock on the diary screen.<br><-<-<-<One thirty-five>->->->. An extraordinary time for a message. Has the ship been sighted?"
"On the north-east side of the street, about midway between the fish and flesh markets in the seaport town of Falmouth, and about the silent and solemn hour of <-<-<-<thirty-six minutes past one>->->-> by my father's watch, on the morning of the 28th day of December, His Gracious Majesty George the Second being King of Great Britain and Ireland, (it is necessary in important matters to be particular). I was introduced with the usual forms and ceremonies into the ancient family of the Hurrys, as the undoubted child of my father Richard and my mother Joan, the ninth, and as it subsequently proved, the last of their promising offspring."
"Major Yun appeared at General Castleton's elbow, and handed an interface to the base leader.

"At <-<-<-<01:42>->->-> and 26 seconds, the plane hit the side of Nimitz Hill, a densely vegetated mountain three miles southwest of the airport - $60 million and 212,000 kilograms of steel slamming into rocky ground at one hundred miles per hour."

"She knew it was the stress, two long days of stress, and she looked at her watch, <-<-<-<sixteen minutes to two>->->->, and she almost leaped with fright, a shock wave rippling through her body, where had the time gone?"
"In the end I accepted a glass of claret. It seemed both churlish and censorious to let him drink alone. The carriage-clock stuck <-<-<-<1:45>->->-> before he roused himself and said: ""Sorry, Cousin. Rather drunk. Be glad of your shoulder. To bed, to sleep, perchance to dream."""
"When it was ten or <-<-<-<fifteen minutes to two>->->-> the deacon would come in; he was a lanky young man of twenty-two, with long hair, with no beard and hardly a perceptible mustache. Going into the drawing room, he crossed himself before the ikon, smiled, and held out his hand to Von Koren.<br>""Good morning,"" the zoologist said coldly. ""Where have you been?"""
"Kaplan looked even more like hell than usual. The skin across the tops of his cheeks and around his eyes was blistered from frostbite. His limping indicated that he'd probably frostbitten some toes as well. The last communication from him the night before had been at <-<-<-<1:45 A.M.>->->->, when he radioed to let the department know he was finally giving up."
"That particular phenomenon got Presto up at <-<-<-<one forty-six a.m.>->->->; silently, he painted his face and naked body with camouflage paint. He opened the door to his room and stepped out into the common lobby."
"That night Cork woke, looked at the clock on the stand beside the bed - <-<-<-<1:47 A.M.>->->-> - and realized he was alone."
"Friday <-<-<-<1:47 A.M.>->->-><br>""Will he help?"" Yuri Androv surveyed the eleven men in the darkened control room.

"Monsieur Pamplemousse had not one, but several large ""pick-me-ups"" before he retired for the night. Consequently it took him rather longer than usual to regain consciousness when the phone rang for the seond time. Screwing up his eyes, it was a moment or two before he deciphered the figures <-<-<-<01.49>->->-> on the digital bedside clock, and several more before he finally made sense of what was being said."
"She had to get out of this goddam camper. It might be the biggest, luxiest one in the world, but right now it felt the size of a coffin. She made her way to the door, holding onto things to keep her balance. She glanced at the clock on the dashboard before she went out. <-<-<-<Ten to two>->->->.

"<-<-<-<1:55 A.M.>->->->, Bayside, Queens<br>Two sets of stairs led to the basement apartment shared by Randall al-Hakim and Abdul ed-Din - one from the tiny backyard and the second from inside the home."
"Mr. Peripart, Sir, at <-<-<-<01:56>->->-> you ordered me back into shutdown mode."
"Then I opened my eyes and looked at my watch. It was <-<-<-<one fifty-seven>->->->. Twenty-five minutes had vanished somewhere. Not bad, I told myself. A pointless way of whittling away time. Not bad at all."
It was <-<-<-<two minutes to two>->->->. I checked my flashlight and envelope and let the inside of my arm touch the firmness of my holster through my jacket. It was reassuring.
"I woke to the dogs barking. I heard a door slam, and the sound of him moving into the kitchen. The fire had died out, the new wood unburned, but the lamp was still on. I peered at my watch; it was <-<-<-<almost two a.m.>->->-> I felt cold and nauseous. I got up and smoothed my hair. I nudged Karen with a toe; she blinked awake."
"For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship's computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, and close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. ""<-<-<-<One ... fifty-nine>->->-> …"""
"So when Dom, looking agitated and desperate, pounded on Tom's door at <-<-<-<two in the morning>->->-> and said he would erase a chunk of the debt in return for an ""errand,"" Tom knew he had no choice. Besides, this wasn't really an offer; it was a command."
“That night I awoke around <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> to the sound of distant thunder and realized all over again that Mr. Harrigan was dead.<br>I was in my bed and he was in the ground.”
"Then yesterday morning a student - Amy Chan - was brought into the Twin Falls station by her mother. Amy claimed she had seen Leena stumbling drunkenly along the Devil’s Bridge sidewalk at around <-<-<-<2:00 a.m.>->->-> on Saturday, November 15."
"“The clock in the centre on the wall in the cafe chimed to announce it was <-<-<-<Two o’clock in the morning>->->->. In the middle of the night, everything was silent.”"
"“It’s a delusional painter who finishes a canvas at <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> and expects radical societal transformation by four. Even when artists write manifestos, they are (hopefully) aware that their exigent tone is, finally, borrowed, only echoing and mimicking the urgency of the guerrilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests, rather than truly enacting it. The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art.”"
"Jessica heard the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the light beside her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about <-<-<-<2 A.M.>->->->"
"“My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:<br>“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about <-<-<-<two in the morning>->->->, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss.”"
"With the wigs taken care of, he puts on of the blank Staples notebooks beside his personal lappie and begins a virtual tour of houses and apartments for rent. He finds a number of possibles, but any boots-on-the-ground investigation will have to wait until he gets his goods from Amazon.<br>It’s only <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> when he finishes his virtual house-hunting, too early to call it a day. It’s actually time to start writing."
"According to his Timex, it was <-<-<-<two in the morning>->->->. The room was cold, but his arms and chest were slimy with sweat.<br>Want some advice, Honeybear?<br>“No,” he said. “Not from you.”"
"Although it was <-<-<-<two in the morning>->->->, Momo answered on the second ring. She was eighty-five, and her sleep was as thin as her skin."
"“I’ll try the Infermiterol,” I said curtly.<br>“Good. And eat a high-dairy meal each day. Did you know that cows can choose to sleep standing up or lying down? Given the option, I know what 𝘐’𝘥 pick. Have you ever made yogurt on the stove? Don’t answer that. We’ll save the cooking lesson for our next meeting. Now write this down because I have a feeling you’re too psychotic to remember: Saturday, January twentieth, at <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->->. And try the Infermiterol. Bye bye.”"
"When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. <-<-<-<Two o’clock>->->-> and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires."
"Henry held out his hand for the note, which Victoria gave over in exchange for a Sweet Caporal. There were only four words: 𝘛𝘰𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘳𝘰𝘸 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨. <-<-<-<2 𝘰’𝘤𝘭𝘰𝘤𝘬>->->->."
"She knew he must have his own history of her, everything from the cinnamon-flavored ChapStick she used on her lips in the winter to the smell of her shampoo when he nuzzled the back of her neck (that nuzzle didn’t come so often now, but it still came) to the click of her computer at <-<-<-<two in the morning>->->-> on those two or three nights a month when sleep for some reason jilted her."
She shut off her computer and climbed to the second floor at a slow trudge. The shower eased her back and couple of Tylenol would probably ease it more by <-<-<-<two AM>->->-> or so; she was sure she’d be awake to find out.
"At <-<-<-<2:00 a.m.>->->-> the night peaked, and the trio decided to head back to Cleo and Frank’s place. Zoe was sitting with Audrey on the large fire escape learning how to roll the perfect joint when Cleo clambered out, her arms laden with colorful Popsicles."
“Saturday afternoon?” she asked.<br>He winked at Billy and squeezed the girl’s head in the crook of his arm. “No. <-<-<-<Two o’clock>->->-> Saturday night. Slip up and knock on that same window you was at this morning. I’ll talk the night aide into letting you in.”
"“I’ve been waiting here all night,” Shawn said. “Tell me everything.”<br>“Shawn,” she said. “It’s all amazing. Where do I even begin . . .”<br>They talked until <-<-<-<two A.M.>->->->"
"Nearly four months after her marriage to Hossein and three days after the momentous Black Friday massacre in Jaleh Square, Bahar had crept into her sisters’ Tehran apartment at <-<-<-<two in the morning>->->->. She slipped so quietly into the single bed she had once shared with little Layla that Marjan did not notice her until the coming of dawn."
"At <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> back at the Weatherbys’ Sally asked her if she and Amory had had a “time” in the den. Isabelle turned to her quietly. In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate dreamer of Joan-like dreams."
"As <-<-<-<two o'clock>->->-> pealed from the cathedral bell, Jean Valjean awoke."
"Get on plane at <-<-<-<2 A.M.>->->->, amid bundles, chickens, gypsies, sit opposite pair of plump fortune tellers who groan and (very discreetly) throw up all the way to Tbilisi."
"Lady Macbeth: Out, damned spot; out, I say. One, <-<-<-<two>->->->,—why, then ’tis time to do’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?"
"Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though oppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it. After an unnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as it were unexpectedly rapid, chime - as though someone were suddenly jumping forward. <-<-<-<It struck two.>->->-> I woke up, though I had indeed not been asleep but lying half-conscious."
"When all had grown quiet and Fyodor Pavlovich went to bed at around <-<-<-<two o'clock>->->->, Ivan Fyodorovich also went to bed with the firm resolve of falling quickly asleep, as he felt horribly exhausted."
I checked my watch. <-<-<-<2.01 am.>->->-> The cheeseburger Happy Meal was now only a distant memory. I cursed myself for not also ordering a breakfast sandwich for the morning.
"The middle of the night? Alec asked sharply. ""Can you be more definite?""<br>""<-<-<-<About two. Just past.>->->->"" Daisy noted that he expressed no concern for her safety."
"At <-<-<-<three minutes past two>->->->, the lights in the motel corridor flickered and went out, leaving the long hallway in relative darkness, the spill from the stairwell the only source of illumination."
"Wake up.<br>""Having the worst dream.""<br>""I should certainly say you were.""<br>""It was awful. It just went on and on.""<br>""I shook you and shook you and.""<br>""Time is it.""<br>""It's nearly - <-<-<-<almost 2:04>->->->."""
"Wake up.<br>""Having the worst dream.""<br>""I should certainly say you were.""<br>""It was awful. It just went on and on.""<br>""I shook you and shook you and.""<br>""Time is it.""<br>""It's nearly - almost <-<-<-<2:04>->->->."""
"<-<-<-<2:05 A.M.>->->->, Flushing, Queens<br>Her cellphone, set on vibrate, rested on the night table next to the bed."
At <-<-<-<2.05>->->-> the fizzy tights came crackling off.
"Then he began ringing the bell. In about ten minutes his valet appeared, half dressed, and looking very drowsy. ""I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,"" he said, stepping in; ""but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?""<br>""<-<-<-<Five minutes past two>->->->, sir,"" answered the man, looking at the clock and yawning.<br>""Five minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine to-morrow. I have some work to do."""
He checked his watch: <-<-<-<six minutes past two>->->->. He closed the bedroom door and walked slowly downstairs. He opened the front door to see his car parked by the curb.
And the time was <-<-<-<six minutes past two>->->->. And what of Jonah? He and Harry would probably arrive about five minutes too late.
"The middle of the night? Alec asked sharply. ""Can you be more definite?""<br>""<-<-<-<About two. Just past.>->->->"" Daisy noted that he expressed no concern for her safety."
"At <-<-<-<2:07 a.m.>->->-> I decided that I wanted a drink of orange squash before I brushed my teeth and got into bed, so I went downstairs to the kitchen. Father was sitting on the sofa watching snooker on the television and drinking whisky. There were tears coming out of his eyes."
But I couldn't sleep. And I got out of bed at <-<-<-<2.07 a.m.>->->-> and I felt scared of Mr. Shears so I went downstairs and out of the front door into Chapter Road.
"Saturday, 17 November — <-<-<-<2.07 a.m.>->->-> I cannot sleep. Ben is upstairs, back in bed, and I am writing this in the kitchen. He thinks I am drinking a cup of cocoa that he has just made for me. He thinks I will come back to bed soon. I will, but first I must write again."
"She dressed quickly, and finished tying the second sneaker. The clock now said <-<-<-<2:08>->->->."
"<-<-<-<2:09 AM>->->->, Jamaica, Queens<br>Outside the al-Dawla home, FBI agents were in position - not only on the ground, but also on the partial first story roof outside the second floor bedroom windows."
"She switched on her bedside light, fumbled for her spectacles and peered at the carriage clock ticking gently on her bedside table. It was only <-<-<-<ten past two>->->->. There was no hope of waiting until morning."
"FBI agents in body armor, gas masks, and night vision goggles secured the main floor and removed the elderly homeowners. Unfortunately, the couple was awake, and the wife screamed at the invasion of their bedroom. The noise made it necessary to move immediately, rather than waiting for the scheduled <-<-<-<2:10>->->->."
"“<-<-<-<Ten minutes past two>->->->, sir,"" answered the man, looking at the clock and blinking. ""Ten minutes past two? How horribly late!"""
"Decided to get under way again as soon as there is any clearance. Snowing and blowing, force about fifty or sixty miles an hour. February 26, Saturday - Richards went out 1:10 am and found it clearing a bit, so we got under way as soon as possible, which was <-<-<-<2:10 am>->->->"
"Well hidden, each phone waited like an amoral soldier, devoid of compassion, for its orders. And those orders came at precisely <-<-<-<2:11>->->->:17 AM EST."
"At <-<-<-<two twelve A.M.>->->->, Werner knows, the Frenchman will broadcast again, and Werner will have to switch off the transceiver or else pretend that he hears only static."
"Then the lights went out all over the city. It happened at <-<-<-<2.12 am>->->-> according to power-house records, but Blake's diary gives no indication of the time. The entry is merely, 'Lights out - God help me.'"
"Now, listen: your destination is Friday, 4 August 1944, and the window will punch through at 22.30 hours. You're going to a dimension that diverged from our own at <-<-<-<02.13>->->-> on the morning of Wednesday 20 February 1918, over twenty-six years earlier. You don't know what it's going to be like."
There are no more lights on now than when he arrived. That's something to be positive about. No great commotion in the building after the shooting. A glance at the clock in the car: <-<-<-<fourteen minutes past two>->->->.
"He scrolled through [the emails], mentally dismissing the vast majority as low priority, but one in particular triggered his curiosity: it was from Art Bullock, sent at <-<-<-<2:15 a.m.>->->-> The subject line read: URGENT FOR FRIDAY MORNING."
"It was the middle of the night when the phone rang. He opened his eyes to find the clock reading <-<-<-<2:15>->->->. At first he was too groggy to grasp why a bell might be ringing nearby, but he shook his head and, almost unconsciously, picked up the receiver and held it to his ear."
"At <-<-<-<2.15 am>->->-> a policeman observed the place in darkness, but with the stranger's motor still at the curb."
"It did. When the alarm rang at <-<-<-<two fifteen>->->->, Lew shut it off, snapped on the little bedside lamp, then swung his feet to the floor to sit on the edge of the bed, holding his eyes open."
"Didn't you hear what I told you in the aircraft? General Scott's aircraft crashed in the desert at <-<-<-<02:16 hours>->->-> this morning, killing all aboard."
"<-<-<-<Two-seventeen>->->->, he marveled. It was the strangest time he'd seen in his entire life.<br>""I apologize that the room is so messy,"" Lalitha said.<br>""I like it. I love how you are. Are you hungry? I'm a little hungry.""<br>""No, Walter."" She smiled. ""I'm not hungry. But I can get you something.""<br>""I was thinking, like, a glass of soy milk. Soy beverage."""
"One of the ""choppers"" stopped, did an about-turn and came back to me. The flare spluttered and faded, and now the glare of the spotlight blinded me. I sat very still. It was <-<-<-<2.17>->->->. Against the noise of the blades a deeper resonant sound bit into the chill black air."
"It was <-<-<-<2:18 in the morning>->->->, and Donna could see no one else in any other office working so late."
"With the secondary reduction gear useless, there was no way the Petros Jupiter could proceed and at <-<-<-<02.19>->->-> the master contacted Land's End coastguard station on VHF to inform the watch officer of the situation and enquire about the availability of a tug."
"She turned abruptly to the nurse and asked the time. '<-<-<-<Two-twenty>->->->' 'Ah...Two-twenty!' Genevieve repeated, as though there was something urgent to be done."
"The night of his third walk Lew slept in his own apartment. When his eyes opened at <-<-<-<two twenty>->->->, by the green hands of his alarm, he knew that this time he'd actually been waiting for it in his sleep."
"<-<-<-<Twenty minutes after two>->->->, on my way to San Diego, listening to some weird, cacophanous music; no melodic line, no content."
"She woke up with a start, on a strange bed in a cold room. As rain pounded against the window, driven by a hammering wind, she remembered where she was and why she was still there.<br>For long tense moments, she didn’t move, letting the blurred edges of sleep slip away.<br><-<-<-<2:21 A.M.>->->-><br>So much for her vaguely sexual dreams."
<-<-<-<2:21 a.m.>->->-> Lance-Corporal Hartmann emerged from the house in the Rue de Londres.
"It was the urge to look up at the sky. But of course there was no sun nor moon nor stars overhead. Darkness hung heavy over me. Each breath I took, each wet footstep, everything wanted to slide like mud to the ground. I lifted my left hand and pressed on the light of my digital wristwatch. <-<-<-<Two-twenty-one>->->->. It was midnight when we headed underground, so only a little over two hours had passed. We continued walking down, down the narrow trench, mouths clamped tight."
"After two more visits, the most celebrated practitioner told Popanilla that his disorder was ‘unquestionably nervous;’ that he had over-excited himself by talking too much; that in future he must count five between each word he uttered, never ask any questions, and avoid society; that is, never stay at an evening party on any consideration later than <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes past two>->->->, and never be induced by any persuasion to dine out more than once on the same day."
"Abruptly her stomach growled. She had been too keyed up to eat very much after the accident, and now hunger pangs her in in earnest.<br>She glanced at the clock again.<br><-<-<-<2:22 A.M.>->->->"
"Lying beside her husband, as close as possible given the narrowness of the bed, but also out of choice, how much it had cost them in the middle of the night to maintain some decorum, not to behave like those whom someone had referred to as pigs, the doctor's wife looked at her watch. It was <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes past two>->->->."
"It was <-<-<-<2.24 am>->->->. She stumbled out of bed, tripping on her shoes that she’d kicked off earlier and pulled on a jumper."
"It's <-<-<-<2:25 in the morning>->->->, and Sean is calling. Stephen quietly slipped out of bed, and exited the bedroom. With Sean, it could be a family matter, a threat to the country, or countless things in between."
You see it is time: <-<-<-<2.25 am>->->->. You get out of bed.
Listened to a voicemail message left at <-<-<-<2.26 am>->->-> by Claude.
"The request was granted, but not until another form had been completed and signed. Dexter Hutchins put a collect call through to the Director of the CIA at <-<-<-<2:27>->->-> that morning."
The hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the Bloomsbury Centre's four thousand rooms marked <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past two>->->->.
The moon didn’t shine again until <-<-<-<2.27 am>->->->. It was enough to show Wallander that he was positioned some distance below the tree.
<-<-<-<2.28 am>->->->: Ran out of sheep and began counting other farmyard animals.
"He didn't have to deal with notoriously bad Italian drivers at <-<-<-<nearly 2:30 in the morning>->->->, and the safehouse was just a few streets away from the Colosseum, a structure that had been standing in Rome since opening in 80 A.D."
"“Oh, Daddy,” I said. Blubbering now. “He’s not dead. At least he wasn’t at <-<-<-<two-thirty>->->-> this morning. We’ve got to dig him up. We have to, because we buried him alive.”"
She looked at her watch: <-<-<-<half past two>->->->. A few minutes to calm down before she had to go.
"I'm in mufti myself: white gloves and matching tennis shoes. But I'm sorry to report that Jo is still in her Dr. Dentons. What're you wearing, Shirl?<br>""My old drum majorette's outfit. The one I wore to the State Finals. Listen, we can't tie up the phones like this.""<br>""Why not?"" said Harry. ""Who's going to call at <-<-<-<2:30 a.m.>->->-> with a better idea? Yippee, to quote Lew, we're having a party! What're we serving, Lew?""<br>""Beer, I guess. Haven't got any wine, have we, Jo?""<br>""Just for cooking."""
At about <-<-<-<half past two>->->-> she had been woken by the creak of footsteps out on the stairs. At first she had been frightened.
"Inc, I tried to pull her off about <-<-<-<0230>->->->, and there was this fucking… sound."
"It is <-<-<-<2.30 am>->->-> and I am tight. As a tick, as a lord, as a newt. Must write this down before the sublime memories fade and blur."
And then I woke up because there were people shouting in the flat and it was <-<-<-<2.31 a.m.>->->-> And one of the people was Father and I was frightened.
"The last guests departed at <-<-<-<2.32 a.m.>->->->, two hours and two minutes after the scheduled completion time."
"But it wasn't going on! It was two-thirty-four, well. <-<-<-<Two-thirty-three>->->-> and nothing had happened. Suppose he got a room call, or the elevator night-bell rang, now."
"But it wasn't going on! It was <-<-<-<two-thirty-four>->->->, well. Two-thirty-three and nothing had happened. Suppose he got a room call, or the elevator night-bell rang, now."
"Matson and the Chairman had driven back from Mark’s apartment at <-<-<-<2:35>->->-> that morning, their task completed. Matson had overslept by thirty minutes. The damned hotel had forgotten his wake-up call; you couldn’t trust anyone nowdays."
I crept down the stairs careful to avoid the steps I knew would cry my presence to my father who had taken to sleeping on the sofa in the living room. In the kitchen I saw by moonlight that the hands of the wall clock read <-<-<-<two-thirty-five>->->->.
"The lit-up screen offered no information about the caller, but it did reveal that it was <-<-<-<2:35 in the morning>->->->."
Rorschach’s journal: Left Jacob’s house <-<-<-<2:35 a.m.>->->-> He knows nothing about any attempt to discredit Dr. Manhattan. He has simply been used.
"For what happened at <-<-<-<2.35>->->-> we have the testimony of the priest, a young, intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monohan of the Central Station, an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd."
"“Drive safe,” says Ned. He texted me to send the van. That was at <-<-<-<2:36>->->->, I know because I looked at the clock, the art deco one right over there, see? Keeps perfect time. Then, I dunno, he just vanished."
"It was about <-<-<-<2.36 am>->->-> when a provost colonel arrived to arrest me. At 2.36 1/2 I remembered the big insulating gauntlets. But even had I remembered before, what could I have done?"
"He was out at least a couple miles from the nearest gas station, and he’d thrown his cell phone out the window in Arkansas after briefly becoming convinced the NSA was tracking him. He plucked the kitchen timer from his pocket: <-<-<-<02:37>->->->:47. He would have to hoof it."
"June 13, 1990. <-<-<-<Thirty-seven minutes past two>->->-> in the morning. And sixteen seconds."
"It was true that the striking apparatus had long ago failed to agree with the hands; and the hands themselves, owing to the accumulated inaccuracies of years, no longer denoted the real time; nevertheless, whenever it struck seven he could always be sure that the hands were pointing to a quarter-past twelve, and it was then just <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes to three>->->->."
"Noo, there's a report come in fra' the station-master at Pinwherry that there was a gentleman tuk the <-<-<-<2.39>->->-> at Pinwherry."
"When her watch showed <-<-<-<two-forty>->->->, she was ready to leave. She put on her darkest coat, a large box of matches already in her pocket, and tied a scarf over her head."
"Miss Conover told investigators that at <-<-<-<2:40 a.m.>->->->, Officer Martin Willis entered the diner and ordered coffee and donut."
"His aides had wanted a long, flowery announcement filled with stirring phrases and fulsome praise for their various generals. Eisenhower had tossed their suggestions aside and written - ah! there it is: ""The mission of this Allied force was fulfilled at <-<-<-<02.41>->->-> local time, May 7, 1945."""
"This time it was a bird, a crow, wearing the goggles. Patterson had decrypted the telegram, and now read it quickly. GODDESS 4 reports that GENIUS left the salon at <-<-<-<02.42>->->-> ZULU."
"She settled back beside him. ""It's <-<-<-<2:43>->->->:12 am, Case. Got a readout chipped into my optic nerve."""
"Max woke from the nightmare with a gasp, eyes flying open in the pitch-black room. She blinked twice and muffled a groan as the <-<-<-<02:43>->->-> timestamp appeared in her vision. ""You've never even seen a real bear,"" she muttered."
You got here at <-<-<-<sixteen minutes to three>->->->. Ron looked at his watch.
"When he woke up it was already night, and the moon was shining into the room. He looked at his watch: it was a <-<-<-<quarter to three>->->->. Sleep had left him; he sat down upon his bed and thought of the funeral of the old Countess."
"He glanced down at his watch. He had been smiling as he stroked her awake, and was smiling now. “<-<-<-<Quarter to three>->->->. I sat in my stupid old motel room for almost two hours after we talked, trying to convince myself that what I was thinking couldn’t be true. Only I didn’t get where I am by dodging the truth.”"
"<-<-<-<0245h>->->->., Ennet House, the hours that are truly wee."
"WE NEVER KNOW, AT FIRST, if we are headed into a cooker or a smudge. At <-<-<-<2:46 A.M.>->->-> last night, the lights went on upstairs. The bells went off, too, but I can’t say that I ever really hear them. In ten seconds, I was dressed and walking out the door of my room at the station."
"<-<-<-<2.46 am>->->->. The chain drive whirred and the paper target slid down the darkened range, ducking in and out of shafts of yellow incandescent light. At the firing station, a figure waited in the shadows. As the target passed the twenty-five-foot mark, the man opened fire: eight shots-rapid, unhesitating."
"Vicki shoved her glasses at her face and peered at the clock. <-<-<-<Two forty-six>->->->. 'I don't have time for this' she muttered, settling back against the pillows, heart still slamming against her ribs."
"The glowing numbers read <-<-<-<2.47 am>->->->. Moisés sighs and turns back to the bathroom door. Finally, the doorknob turns and Conchita comes back to bed. She resumes her place next to Moisés. Relieved, he pulls her close."
"And you keep quiet, Betty. There may be trouble. He almost pushed her off the desk toward Max. A second later he had darkened the room by flicking the switch by the foyer door. Through the door, the clock showed <-<-<-<twelve minutes to three>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<2:49 a.m.>->->->, the town clerk walked back to the microphone and tapped it once again. The momentary silence was broken only by a pencil falling off a table and rolling across the floor."
"When it was <-<-<-<2:50>->->-> and the bank, too, had not been attacked, it was clear this was not the day of the big coup."
"Thursday <-<-<-<2:51 A.M.>->->-><br>A very wet, very annoyed Michael Vance rapped on the door of Zeno Stantopoulos's darkened kafeneion. He'd walked the lonely back road into Iraklion in the dark, guiding himself by the rain-battered groves of plane trees, olive, and wild pear, trying to figure out what in hell was happening."
"It was an impulse, born of aloneness. It was <-<-<-<eight minutes to three in the morning>->->->, Sunday morning."
"They reached the first roadblock on the outskirts of the town of Bulawayo, and Craig checked his wrist-watch. It was <-<-<-<seven minutes to three>->->-> in the morning."
The times have changed and I can tell you exactly when they did - The times changed at exactly <-<-<-<six minutes to three>->->-> last Friday morning.
"The dashboard clock showed <-<-<-<five minutes to three>->->->, later than Theo had expected. The road, narrow and deserted, opened palely before them, then slid under the wheels like a strip of torn and soiled linen."
"It's the way the world will end, Harry. Recorded cocktail music nuclear-powered to play on for centuries after all life has been destroyed. Selections from 'No, No, Nanette,' throughout eternity. That do you for <-<-<-<2:55 a.m.>->->->?"
"Time to go: <-<-<-<2.55 am>->->->. Two-handed, Cec lifted his peak cap from the chair."
It was <-<-<-<2:56>->->-> when the shovel touched the coffin. We all heard the sound and looked at each other.
It was <-<-<-<02:57>->->-> GMT. Yahaya slipped from his hiding place and cradled the syringe he had robbed from the ship's hospital in his right hand.
"But generally it’s the other way, the slow way. She’ll turn that dial to a dead stop and freeze the sun there on the screen so it don’t move a scant hair for weeks, so not a leaf on a tree or a blade of grass in the pasture shimmers. The clock hands hang at <-<-<-<two minutes to three>->->-> and she’s liable to let them hang there till we rust."
"He climbed off his bed at <-<-<-<2:59 a.m.>->->->, fully rested, fully alert, walked over to the large trunk in the middle of the cabin and lifted its lid."
"I wish it left sooner, Sophie said, ""but Lyon will have to do.""<br>Sooner? Langdon checked his watch <-<-<-<2:59 A. M.>->->-> The train left in seven minutes and they didn’t even have tickets yet."
"I remembered arriving in this room at <-<-<-<2.59>->->-> one night. I remembered the sergeant who called me names: mostly Anglo-Saxon monosyllabic four-letter ones with an odd Commie"" thrown in for syntax."""
"At <-<-<-<3:00 A.M.>->->->, a gray DeSoto Diplomat cruised up and down Oliver Avenue. The lone occupant looked for any sign of movement---anything out of the ordinary."
"Worst of all was that Henrick used such pointed and mercilessly concrete examples. If he was preaching about mercy, he would describe the lot of the poor in such a way that the people could picture someone of the captain's many crofters leaving his home at <-<-<-<three o'clock in the morning>->->-> with a sack of grain on his back, how he slaved in the fields, how he often must go without the noon meal in order to get to the mill at last after thirteen hours of labor and after picking up his flour, return home through the woods, carrying his heavy load."
The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at <-<-<-<three in the morning>->->->.
"Holly gets up at <-<-<-<three o’clock in the morning>->->->. She’s packed, she’s printed out her Delta ticket, she doesn’t have to be at the airport until seven and it’s a short ride, but she can’t sleep anymore."
"Who was that woman? She’d suspect, then be wrong. The shadowy presence laughed at her softly from the sleepless darkness of <-<-<-<3 a.m.>->->->, then slid away. She couldn’t pin anything down."
"“What are you doing?” he asked.<br>“I thought it would be better if we locked the doors,” said Willa. “Just in case.”<br>“It’s <-<-<-<three o’clock in the morning>->->->.”<br>“All the more reason for it.”<br>Markovic looked at her oddly before returning to the lounge."
"The American team had flown into Vienna on a Gulfstream jet from a regional airport in eastern Poland, where the CIA had maintained a base for rendition purposes since the start of the War on Terror. It was not, therefore, the unit’s first day at the office. They were already watching when, at <-<-<-<3 a.m.>->->->, two cars rook up positions within sight of the main and rear doors of the hotel, the first of the vehicles having initially circles the block three times."
"Tony was hardened off early. This is what she calls it by now, ruefully, in her cellar, at <-<-<-<three a.m.>->->->, with the shambles of Otto the Red’s clove army strewn on the sand-table behind her and West sleeping the sleep of the unjust upstairs, and Zenia raging unchecked, somewhere out there in the city."
"Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard <-<-<-<three>->->-> proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep."
“Uncle Nuri!” he says when he sees me moving. “You’ve been sleeping for such a long time.” The clock on the wall says <-<-<-<3 a.m.>->->->
Mindy Park stared at the ceiling. She had little else to do. The <-<-<-<three a.m.>->->-> shift was pretty dull. Only a constant stream of coffee kept her awake.
I found myself typing “serial killer” into the Google search box at <-<-<-<3 a.m.>->->->
"About <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> the four couples, frightened at their happiness, were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the Champs Élysées."
"A few moments later, about <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->->, Courfeyrec chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air."
"I woke up half out of bed, the covers pulled loose and wound around me in a kind of shroud, heart pumping, clawing at my own mouth. It took several seconds for me to realize there was nothing in there. Nonetheless, I got up, went to the bathroom, and drank two glasses of water. I may have had worse dreams than the one that woke me at <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> on that Tuesday morning, but if so, I can’t remember them."
"As if it had roused him—perhaps it had—Lane lifted his head and looked at me. Tried to look at me; his eyes had come back level in their sockets, but were now pointing in opposite directions. That terrible image has never left my mind, and still comes to me at the oddest times: going through turnpike tollbooths, drinking a cup of coffee in the morning with the CNN anchors baying bad news, getting up to piss at <-<-<-<three AM>->->->, which some poet or other has rightly dubbed the Hour of the Wolf."
"I looked around the room again. As always, the room was clean and orderly.<br>“People think of all kinds of things at <-<-<-<three in the morning>->->->. We all do. That’s why we each have to figure out our own way of fighting it off.”<br>“You’re probably right,” I said."
"“Even animals think things over at <-<-<-<three a.m.>->->->,” he said, as if remembering something. “Have you ever gone to the zoo at three a.m.?”<br>“No,” I answered vaguely. “No, of course not.”"
"All the doors were locked, everything in its proper place. Nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to the janitor’s room, set my alarm for <-<-<-<three>->->->, and fell fast asleep."
"When the alarm went off at <-<-<-<three>->->->, though, I woke up feeling weird. I can’t explain it, but I just felt different. I didn’t feel like getting up—it was like something was suppressing my will to get out of bed. I’m the type who usually leaps right out of bed, so I couldn’t understand it."
"The preliminaries over, having made peepee and blown his nose vigorously, he walks nonchalantly over to his wench and gives her a big, smacking kiss together with an affectionate pat on the rump. Her, the wench, I’ve never seen look anything but immaculate—even at <-<-<-<3 a.m.>->->->, after an evening’s work. She looks exactly as if she had just stepped out of a Turkish bath."
"And now it is <-<-<-<three o’clock in the morning>->->-> and we have a couple of trollops here who are doing somersaults on the bare floor. Fillmore is walking around naked with a goblet in his hand, and that paunch of his is drumtight, hard as a fistula."
"Jarvis whistled through his teeth. “Will the law help a man of your years bounce back from multiple spinal fractures, Timothy?”<br>Eddie: “Men of your age don’t bounce. They splat.”<br>I fought with all my might, but my sphincter was no longer my own and a cannonade fired off. Amusement or condescension I could have borne, but my tormentors’ pity signified my abject defeat. The toilet chain was pulled.<br>“<-<-<-<Three o’clock>->->->,” Cavendish-Redux went down the pan."
"Indeed, at <-<-<-<three o’clock in the morning>->->-> in the village of Bishopthorpe, it is easy to believe the lie indulged in by its residents - that it is a place for good and quiet people to live good and quiet lives."
"The light on at <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> this Friday morning belongs to him, Rowan, the elder of the two Radley children. He is wide awake, despite having drunk six times the recommended dose of Night Nurse."
"Spent last night working on a rumbling ’cello 𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘨𝘳𝘰 lit by explosive triplets. Silence punctuated by breakneck mousetraps. Remember the church clock chiming <-<-<-<three A.M.>->->-> “I heard an owl,” Huckleberry Finn says, “away and off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die.”"
"He couldn’t sleep that night, a tightness in his chest as if a serpent had wound its coils around him. At <-<-<-<three in the morning>->->-> the phone by his bed began to ring. Ada’s voice, almost unrecognizable, her gasps between words no less desperate than her sobs."
"When at <-<-<-<three in the morning>->->-> she was still awake, her mind ticking off all the ways she kept failing at parenting, she threw off her blanket and padded to the kitchen. The Scotch she poured went down warm and hit hot, and she took another swig before collapsing into bed and finally disconnecting."
"It did not help, either, that she had been up half the night with Josie, who’d awakened from a nightmare<br>about a boa constrictor and refused to go back to sleep. Alex didn’t know who the other candidates were for this position, but she’d wager that they weren’t single moms who’d had to poke the radiator vents with a yardstick at <-<-<-<3:00 a.m.>->->-> to prove that there weren’t any snakes hiding in the dark tunnels."
"And now it was <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->->. The Antichrist had been on Earth for fifteen hours, and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them."
"When the clock struck <-<-<-<three>->->->, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so."
A gambling fever swept through the sophomore class and they bent over the bones till <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> many a sultry night.
"She died this morning, very early, about <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->->."
"Three a.m. That’s our reward. <-<-<-<Three in the morn.>->->-> The soul’s midnight. The tide goes out, the soul ebbs. And a train arrives at an hour of despair. Why?"
"According to her watch it was shortly after <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->->, and according to everything else it was night-time."
<-<-<-<At three am>->->-> I was walking the floor and listening to Katchaturian working in a tractor factory. He called it a violin concerto. I called it a loose fan belt and the hell with it.
"At <-<-<-<three o' clock in the morning>->->-> Eurydice is bound to come into it. After all, why did I sit here like a telegrapher at a lost outpost if not to receive messages from everywhere about the lost Eurydice who was never mine to begin with but whom I lamented and sought continually both professionally and amateurishly."
"But at <-<-<-<three o’clock in the morning>->->->, a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence, and the cure doesn’t work -- and in a real dark night of the soul it is always three o’clock in the morning, day after day."
"Not till she has had one cup of tea, so weak that it has a colour accidentally golden, can she begin her day. She is an insomniac. Her nights are wide-eyed and excited with worry. Even at <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->-> in the morning one might hear her eating a Bain Marie biscuit in the kitchen."
"I slam the phone down but it misses the base. I hit the clock instead, which flashes <-<-<-<3 a.m.>->->->"
"It was six untroubled days later – the best days at the camp so far, lavish July light thickly spread everywhere, six masterpiece mountain midsummer days, one replicating the other – that someone stumbled jerkily, as if his ankles were in chains, to the Comanche cabin’s bathroom <-<-<-<at three A.M.>->->->"
It was <-<-<-<three in the morning>->->-> when his taxi stopped by giant mounds of snow outside his hotel. He had not eaten in hours.
"Once I saw a figure I shall never forget. It was <-<-<-<three o'clock at night>->->->, as I was going home from Blacky as usual; it was a short-cut for me, and there would be nobody in the street at this time of night, I thought, especially not in this frightful cold."
"Roused from her sleep, Freya Gaines groped for the switch of the vidphone; groggily she found it and snapped it on. 'Lo,' she mumbled, wondering what time it was. She made out the luminous dial of the clock beside the bed. <-<-<-<Three AM>->->->. Good grief."
"Schact clears his mouth and swallows mightily. 'Tavis can't even regrout tile in the locker room without calling a Community meeting or appointing a committee. The Regrouting Committee's been dragging along since May. Suddenly they're pulling secret <-<-<-<0300>->->-> milk-switches? It doesn't ring true, Jim."
"<-<-<-<Three in the morning>->->->, thought Charles Halloway, seated on the edge of his bed. Why did the train come at that hour? For, he thought, it’s a special hour. Women never wake then, do they? They sleep the sleep of babes and children. But men in middle age? They know that hour well."
"What's the time? said the man, eyeing George up and down with evident suspicion, ""why, if you listen you will hear it strike.""<br>George listened, and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged. ""But it's only gone <-<-<-<three>->->->!"" said George in an injured tone, when it had finished."
"When Sophie awoke, it was <-<-<-<3:00 a.m.>->->->"
"You hearken, Missy. It’s <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> in the morning and I’ve got all my faculties as well as ever I had in my life. I know all my property and where the money’s put out. And I’ve made everything ready to change my mind, and do as I like at the last. Do you hear, Missy? I’ve got my faculties."
"At <-<-<-<3:01 a.m.>->->->, Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room. Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that sheltered the deserted crafts building."
"Yesterday, at <-<-<-<around three in the morning>->->->, I found my mother unresponsive on her bathroom floor. I’m a hero, they say, because I saved her from a lithium overdose.<br>I’m not a hero. This is all my fault."
"It was now <-<-<-<about three o'clock>->->-> in the morning and Francis Macomber, who had been asleep a little while after he had stopped thinking about the lion, wakened and then slept again."
"I’m not going to just lie here, she thought, and let my life be ruined! And when she heard, “God give you good morrow, my masters! <-<-<-<Past three o’clock>->->-> and a fair morning!” she flung back the covers and got out of bed, turning to shake Nan."
"But after months of checking and rechecking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at <-<-<-<two minutes past three>->->-> Western time on 19 October 1995, had officially been recognized."
At <-<-<-<three minutes past three>->->-> he began his career as one of the celebrities of the world.
"He looked at his front-line clock on the bedside table and noted that it had stopped at <-<-<-<3.04>->->->. So, you couldn’t even rely on alarm clocks."
"Five minutes ago it was three o'clock, Murphy said. ""I can't be certain, but I theorize that it must now be about <-<-<-<three-oh-five>->->->.""<br>I folded my arms. ""I don't usually do stakeouts."""
"On the Sunday before Christmas she awoke at <-<-<-<3:05 a.m.>->->-> and thought: Thirty-six hours. Four hours later she got up thinking: Thirty-two hours. Late in the day she took Alfred to the street-association Christmas party at Dale and Honey Driblett’s, sat him down safely with Kirby Root, and proceeded to remind all her neighbors that her favorite grandson, who’d been looking forward all year to a Christmas in St. Jude, was arriving tomorrow afternoon."
"<-<-<-<3.06 AM>->->-><br>""Here,"" said Miss Pettigrew in a tiny voice. Joe loomed above her. He said no word, but his arm went through hers with that glorious, proprietary, warding male attentiveness never hitherto experienced by Miss Pettigrew. She simply leaned on him weakly."
"He glanced at his watch: <-<-<-<3:07>->->->. Surely it couldn’t be Fiona? He dragged himself out of bed, put on his dressing gown, and reluctantly padded across to the door."
"Wayne late-logged in: <-<-<-<3.07 am>->->-> -the late-late show. He parked. He dumped his milk can. He yawned, he stretched. He scratched."
"The mist was thinning now and he could just discern the Grange itself - a substantial, dark shadow marked by blurs of lights from the windows. His watch showed that it was <-<-<-<eight minutes past three>->->->. So they would all be closeted now in solitary meditation waiting for the four o'clock summons to announce their final votes."
"Hall looked at his Rolex and it was <-<-<-<nine past three>->->->, and yet no cuckoos had announced the hour, not one. How long had this been going on, or not going on?"
Adam licked his fingers and rubbed them over his eyes as he tried to get accustomed to the dark. He checked the little luminous dial on his alarm clock: <-<-<-<ten past three>->->->.
It was <-<-<-<3:10>->->-> in the morning when Pastor Grant finally got back to the parsonage.
I think my credit card was in there too. I wrote down the words credit card and said that if they wouldn't let me cancel them I'd demand that they registered the loss so you couldn't be charge for anything beyond the time of my calling them up. I looked at the clock. It was <-<-<-<ten-past three>->->->.
Love again; wanking at <-<-<-<ten past three>->->->
"The clock said <-<-<-<3:11 AM>->->->.<br>""Yes, hello?""<br>A deep, emotionless voice on the other end asked, ""Is this Pastor Stephen Grant?"""
"A table with anglers' magazines and an ashtray, a few books on a shelf, a candle in a bottle, chairs, a mantel clocked stopped at <-<-<-<twelve minutes past three>->->->."
"It was <-<-<-<3:12 AM>->->->, and Charlie was calling.<br>She answered, ""Are you still sitting outside that hotel?""<br>""Yeah. This is bullshit. I'm going in to get this guy, and I don't care what he's in the middle of doing."""
"You probably won't remember me, but I'm the lucky soul who got beamed down into a human body at <-<-<-<03.13>->->-> GMT."
"Since he had told the girl that it had to end, he'd been waking up every morning at <-<-<-<3.14>->->->, without fail. Every morning his eyes would flick open, alert, and the red numerals on his electric alarm clock would read 3.14."
The boss had had something rather more spectacular than a bowel movement; at <-<-<-<three-fifteen>->->-> that day he had done something in his pants that was the equivalent of a shit A-bomb.
"One night in August, with the good picking done and Old Pie’s crew paid up and back on the rez, I woke to the sound of a cow lowing. 𝘐 𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘭𝘦𝘱𝘵 𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘪𝘮𝘦, I thought, but when I fumbled my father’s pocket watch off the table beside my bed and peered at it, I saw it was <-<-<-<quarter past three in the morning>->->->."
"Above the door of Room 69 the clock ticked on at <-<-<-<3:15>->->->. The motion was accelerating. What had once been the gymnasium was now a small room, seven feet wide, a tight, almost perfect cube."
"Rebecca and Abby are taken to hospital by ambulance, Abby is released several hours later with minor cuts and bruises, Rebecca Louden was pronounced dead at <-<-<-<sixteen minutes past three>->->-> this morning after surgeons failed to repair the damage to her carotid artery."
Hassan checked her watch – <-<-<-<03.17>->->-> – confident that the only person on board still awake would be the young man on the bridge. Rook to bishop’s four. He removed a knight from the board.
Timestamp says <-<-<-<3:17 a.m.>->->-> A large block of text. Not a good sign of things to come.
"It was <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past three in the morning>->->->. Mila, in a trenchcoat and boots, sat down on the edge of the bed. Malik Solanka groaned. Disaster always arrived when your defences were at their lowest: blindsiding you, like love."
"The two of us sat there, listening—Boris more intently than me. “Who’s that with him then?” I said. “Some whore.” He listened for a moment, brow furrowed, his profile sharp in the moonlight, and then lay back down. “Two of them.” I rolled over, and checked my iPod. It was <-<-<-<3:17>->->-> in the morning."
"He turned to the monitors again and flicked through the screens, each one able to display eight different camera mountings, giving Kurt 192 different still lives of Green Oaks at <-<-<-<3.17 a.m.>->->-> this March night."
The truth of the matter we may never know. All we know at the moment is that at <-<-<-<03.18 hours>->->-> on 10th February the Southern Cross was firmly beset by the ice and she was sending out an SOS. Sometime during the night that lead must have come to an end. The westward-driven pack ice closed round her and in a matter of hours she was gone.
The time stamp on Navidson's camcorder indicates that it is exactly <-<-<-<3.19 A.M.>->->->
"Prabath Kumara, 16. 17th November 1989. At <-<-<-<3.20 am>->->-> from the home of a friend."
"He didn’t bother to shower or shave, and dressed quickly in the clothes he had worn the previous day. He left his apartment in Queens at <-<-<-<3:21>->->-> and drove himself into Manhattan, leaving his car outside the front of the precinct a few minutes before four."
"She glanced again at the bedside clock: <-<-<-<3:21>->->->. She got out of bed, put on a dressing gown, sat down at the little table and filled several sheets of hotel stationery with notes in preparation for her meeting with Sefton Jelks. It felt like prepping for an exam."
"Next, he remembered that the morrow of Christmas would be the twenty-seventh day of the moon, and that consequently high water would be at <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes past three>->->->, the half-ebb at a quarter past seven, low water at thirty-three minutes past nine, and half flood at thirty-nine minutes past twelve."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at <-<-<-<03:22>->->-> this morning, our GEODSS sensor suite at Socorro, New Mexico detected an anomalous object outside of the orbit of the moon."
"It is <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes past three>->->->, and his plane leaves at eight A.M."
"Surely not! she gibed. ""Forming a link of transcontinental traffic. Helping to put a girdle 'round the earth in eighty days--or is it forty now?--enlightening the traveling public about the <-<-<-<three-twenty-four>->->-> train; dispensing time-tables and other precious mediums of education--""<br>""I'm happy here,"" he said doggedly."
"It was <-<-<-<3:25 a.m.>->->-> A strange thrill, to think I was the only Mulvaney awake in the house."
"Sinking down heavily on the edge of his unmade bed with his head in his hands, Sam raked his fingers through the messy spikes of his hair before casting a glance at the digital clock on the nightstand. Its little red numbers flashed <-<-<-<03:26>->->-> and he heaved a sigh."
"At <-<-<-<3:27 a.m.>->->->, he called for silence again. “I, Leonard Derek Hardy, being the returning officer…” Heads were bowed, eyes were closed, while some of those present turned away, unable even to face the stage as they crossed their fingers and waited for the numbers to be read out."
"With the Ranger at their head, they went out of town at a fast trot. If there had been anybody there to notice it, he would have seen that the clock on the wall at the Bird Cage registered the time as <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past three>->->->."
Now somebody was running past his room. A door slammed. That foreign language again. What the devil was going on? he switched on his light and peered at his watch. <-<-<-<3.28>->->->. He got out of bed.
Only a message from the CIU. They got the billing on Difford's mobile. The last call was to another mobile at <-<-<-<03.29>->->-> on Sunday morning. Since then no one's used it.
"He was too deeply asleep to hear the noise of his door handle being tried. What woke him was the tapping. It was soft at first, more like a scratching of fingernails on wood, and when he opened his eyes he assumed it was one of the children trying to clamber into their bed after a nightmare. But then he saw the unfamiliar room and he remembered where he was. He squinted at the luminous hands on the hotel’s alarm clock. <-<-<-<Half-past three>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<Half past Three>->->->, a single Bird Unto a silent Sky Propounded but a single term Of cautious melody."
At <-<-<-<half-past three A.M.>->->-> he lost one illusion: officers sent to reconnoitre informed him that the enemy was making no movement.
"It's <-<-<-<3:30 A.M.>->->-> in Mrs. Ralph's finally quiet house when Garp decides to clean the kitchen, to kill the time until dawn. Familiar with a housewife's tasks, Garp fills the sink and starts to wash the dishes."
"Let's go to sleep, I say. Look at what time it is."" The clock radio is right there beside the bed. Anyone can see it says <-<-<-<three-thirty>->->->."""
"Now, look. I am not going to call Dr. McGrath at <-<-<-<three thirty>->->-> in the morning to ask if it's all right for my son to eat worms. That's flat."
"He hesitated for a moment and reached for the Admiral's call icon, touching it as gingerly as if it were the trigger to a nuclear charge. Arashan entered the exact time in his duty log: <-<-<-<03:31 hours>->->->."
"An empty cryogenic support cylinder was eventually found outside his abandoned car at <-<-<-<03:32>->->-> this morning near the village of Hazelbrook, thirty-six miles north of here."
A draft whistled in around the kitchen window frame and I shivered. The digital clock on Perkus's stove read <-<-<-<3:33>->->->.
It was <-<-<-<3:34 am.>->->-> and he was wide-awake. He'd heard the phone ring and the sound of his uncle's voice.
"Three thirty, <-<-<-<3:35>->->->, 3:40. Suddenly there was a massive jolt that almost threw him out of his seat. It was followed by a loud screeching of wheels as the train slowed rapidly, and finally came to a halt."
He could just see the hands of the alarm clock in the darkness: <-<-<-<3.35 a.m.>->->-> He adjusted his pillow and shut his eyes.
"As I near Deadhorse, it's <-<-<-<3:36 a.m.>->->-> and seventeen below. Tall, sodium vapor lights spill on the road and there are no trees, only machines, mechanical shadows. There isn't even a church. It tells you everything."
"It was three <-<-<-<thirty-seven A.M.>->->->, and for once Maggie was asleep. She had got to be a pretty good sleeper in the last few months. Clyde was prouder of this fact than anything."
"At <-<-<-<3.38 am>->->->, it began to snow in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The geese circling the city flew back to the park, landed, and hunkered down to sit it out on their island in the lake."
"23 October 1893 <-<-<-<3.39 am>->->->. Upon further thought, I feel it necessary to explain that exile into the Master's workshop is not an unpleasant fate. It is not simply some bare-walled cellar devoid of stimulation - quite the opposite."
"His bedside clock shows <-<-<-<three forty>->->->. He has no idea what he's doing out of bed: he has no need to relieve himself, nor is he disturbed by a dream or some element of the day before, or even by the state of the world."
The alarm clock said <-<-<-<3.41 am>->->->. He sat up. Why was the alarm clock slow? He picked up the alarm clock and adjusted the hands to show the same time as his wristwatch: 3.44 am
"The phone rang at <-<-<-<3:42 a.m.>->->-> Who could be calling this late? Or rather, ""this early?"" They'd only been asleep for a few hours. Easter Vigil had ended around 11 p.m. and she had then gotten everything ready for the Easter Sunrise Service, which would begin around 6 a.m."
"Let’s see what those search warrants yield. So far Pelley has admitted he was at the bonfire. The lab says his boot imprints are a match to the marks on Leena’s body. Pelley cannot account for the time between when he was last seen leaving the bonfire with his arm around Leena and when he arrived home at <-<-<-<3:42 a.m.>->->-> in a severely inebriated state, according to his wife, Lacey."
"We are due in Yellow Sky at <-<-<-<3:42>->->->, he said, looking tenderly into her eyes.<br>""Oh, are we?"" she said, as if she had not been aware of it. To evince surprise at her husband's statement was part of her wifely amiability."
"The clock says <-<-<-<3.43 am>->->->. The thermometer says it's a chilly fourteen degrees Fahrenheit. The weatherman says the cold spell will last until Thursday, so bundle up and bundle up some more. There are icicles barring the window of the bat cave."
"When I opened my eyes, an oyster-colored dawn was peeping in at the windows. The hands of my brass alarm clock stood at <-<-<-<3:44>->->->."
"It was dark. After she had switched the light on and been to the toilet, she checked her watch: <-<-<-<3.44 a.m.>->->-> She undressed, put the cat out the door and returned to the twin bed."
He touched the face of his watch to check the time: <-<-<-<03.45>->->->. The code that would open the outer door and allow him to descend to the safety of his other world.
"Abra did not quiet. The crying was monotonous, maddening, terrifying. When they arrived at Bridgton Hospital, it was <-<-<-<quarter of four>->->->, and Abra was still at full volume. Rides in the Acura were usually better than a sleeping pill, but not this morning."
"LORD CAVERSHAM: Well, sir! what are you doing here? Wasting your life as usual! You should be in bed, sir. You keep too late hours! I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford's dancing till four o' clock in the morning!<br>LORD GORING: Only a <-<-<-<quarter to four>->->->, father."
"This time the year came first, 88, followed by the month, 09, and finally the time, which had just flicked over to <-<-<-<03 46>->->->."
I saw the Bentley turn onto the school grounds at <-<-<-<three forty-six a.m.>->->-> and the suburban with the two Secret Service agents go by a few minutes later.
I stayed awake until <-<-<-<3:47>->->->. That was the last time I looked at my watch before I fell asleep. It has a luminous face and lights up if you press a button so I could read it in the dark. I was cold and I was frightened Father might come out and find me. But I felt safer in the garden because I was hidden.
"He checked the time, <-<-<-<03.48>->->->, and was about to enter the code when Collins calmly entered the room, dressed in a tailcoat, striped trousers, stiff white collar and grey silk tie."
"When Jeremy and Cuby reached their room it was <-<-<-<twelve minutes to four>->->->. The fire had nearly gone out in their bedroom, but Jeremy went downstairs and brought up more faggots to set it to a new blaze."
"It was <-<-<-<3.49>->->-> when he hit me because of the two hundred times I had said, ""I don't know."" He hit me a lot after that."
"She had used her cell phone to leave several messages on the answering machine in Sao Paulo of the young dentist of the previous evening, whose name was Fernando. The first was recorded at <-<-<-<ten or five to four>->->-> in the morning."
The digital reading on the clock-radio was <-<-<-<3:51>->->->. Always odd numbers at times like this. What does it mean? Is death odd-numbered?
"It was neat, too much so. The log book was open at the last entry: <-<-<-<03.52>->->-> hours - Brady Field Beacon bearing 312°, approximately eight miles."
"I know what old Else has told me, but so far I haven't heard it from you, son. What were you doing in Hog Court at approximately <-<-<-<seven minutes to four>->->-> this morning?"
"The charter flight from Florida touched down at Aldergrove minutes earlier, at <-<-<-<3.54 a.m.>->->->"
"Here in the cavernous basement at <-<-<-<3.55 a.m.>->->->, in a single pool of light, is Theo Perowne."
"It was now <-<-<-<four minutes to four>->->->, and a new day had begun: a day that would likely wrench the cracks apart, turn the bruises into bloody wounds, and shatter to smithereens everything she had patiently made of herself."
He flicked on the bedside light and picked up his watch. It was <-<-<-<3:57>->->->. He began to recall what had taken place a few hours earlier.
"Three minutes to four, she replied, consulting her broad old gold watch, and then holding it to her ear. ""Yes, <-<-<-<three minutes to four>->->->. I thought it was later. You saw something, William Maubray - you did. You have seen something, haven't you?"""
"The ancient house was deserted, the crumbling garage padlocked, and one was just able to discern - by peering through a crack in the bubbling sun on the window - the face of a clock on the opposite wall. The clock had stopped at <-<-<-<two minutes to four>->->-> early in the morning, or who could tell, it may have been earlier still, yesterday in the afternoon, a couple of hours after Kaiser had left Kamaria for Bartica."
The clock atop the clubhouse reads <-<-<-<3:58>->->->.
"And the raw materials of reality without that glue of time are materials adrift and reality is as meaningless as the balsa parts of a model airplane scattered to the wind...I am in my old room, yes, in the dark, certainly, and it is cold, obviously, but what time is it? ""<-<-<-<Nearly four>->->->, son."""
"He turned to Zor Ala. ""You are to make such contacts with the other humans of the colony as you feel advisable, and you will organize several parties from those you feel you can trust. Have them gather in small groups on either side of the main gate, staying in the shadows of the stockade wall. Be sure they are ready at <-<-<-<one minute to four>->->->. Have the members armed with any weapons you can devise."""
"At <-<-<-<four o'clock>->->-> Mark sat in the Fairy's office rereading the last two articles he had written-one for the most respectable of our papers, the other for a more popular organ. This was the only part of the night's work which had anything in it to flatter literary vanity. The earlier hours had been spent in the sterner labor of concocting the news itself."
"She should have told him. It isn’t friendly, the fact that she hasn’t told him. The first time, she told him and they both cried, holding each other closely, consoling each other for some violation they felt as mutual. Then they discussed their problems, sitting up till <-<-<-<four in the morning>->->->, whispering across the kitchen table."
"I followed his gaze to the mantelpiece. The clock had stopped at <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->.<br>“Mon ami, someone has tampered with it. It had still three days to run. It is an eight-day clock, you comprehend?”<br>“But what should they want to do that for? Some idea of a false scent by making the crime appear to have taken place at four o’clock?”"
"The cloud descended, and Bill’s voice was divorced from what transpired in his head. The purple cloud had a notion. It swept down on top of him like smoke billowing from fallen towers. The possibility that all his work and all his travels and all his passion was just farce. His way of coping at <-<-<-<four a.m.>->->-> on a West Texas Highway. His heart thundered, and he dreamt the Truth, but each discovery was a slippery as a fish in the hand, and every time he tried to catch one, it would simply wriggle its tail and be free."
"It’s a delusional painter who finishes a canvas at two o’clock and expects radical societal transformation by <-<-<-<four>->->->. Even when artists write manifestos, they are (hopefully) aware that their exigent tone is, finally, borrowed, only echoing and mimicking the urgency of the guerrilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests, rather than truly enacting it. The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art."
"When the row of clocks in their cases chimed out <-<-<-<four>->->->, he closed the ledger and reached out for the oil lamp on the edge of the counter. Removing the glass chimney, he struck a match and held it to the wick, then replaced the glass and watched the flame’s amber tones fill the room, scattering shadows between the clock faces."
"All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lawton at <-<-<-<four o’clock a.m.>->->-> and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight."
"It was <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> before we finally got away. Now, for some reason, it was Charles and Camilla who weren’t speaking. They’d fought about something - I’d seen them arguing in the yard - and all the way home, in the back seat, they sat side by side and stared straight ahead, their arms folded across their chests in what I am sure they did not realize was a comically identical fashion."
After Francis left I fell asleep again. When I woke up it was <-<-<-<four in the morning>->->->. I had slept for nearly twenty-four hours.
"He wakes up at <-<-<-<four>->->->, and when he goes outside with the new gloves in one hand, Alice is sitting in the eternal motel lawn chair, bundled up in an I LOVE LAS VEGAS sweatshirt and looking up at a rind of moon."
"His mother knew about the no-talking thing. It had happened after Danny had ventured into Room 217 at the Overlook.<br>“Will you talk to Dick?”<br>Lying in his bed, looking up at her, he nodded. His mother called, even though it was <-<-<-<four in the morning>->->->.<br>Late the next day, Dick came. He brought something with him.<br>A present."
"As a sign of respect, Rose took off her tophat and held it by her side.<br>At <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> they trooped back to their encampment in the parking lot, invigorated. They would return the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. They would return until the good steam was exhausted, and then they would move on."
"Vera had been hanging by a thread for a week now, comatose, in and out of Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and this was exactly the sort of night the frail ones picked to go out on. Usually at <-<-<-<4 a.m.>->->->"
"A poet might die at at twenty-one, a revolutionary or a rock start at twenty-four. But after that you assume everything’s going to be all right. You’ve made it past Dead Man’s Curve and you’re out of the tunnel, cruising straight for your destination down a six-lane highway—whether you want to be or not. You get your hair cut; every morning you shave. You aren’t a poet anymore, or a revolutionary or a rock star. You don’t pass out drunk in phone booths or blast out the Doors at <-<-<-<four in the morning>->->->."
"Three months before the block party, before Oliver Dubois drove a stolen truck into his own living room, before somebody shot Step Volkin at Forty-Six Oak Drive, Holly Dubois decided on an early morning walk. Real early. <-<-<-<Four A.M.>->->-> early."
"“Buster,” she whispered, rubbing the little shih tzu to wake him. After all, walking by herself at <-<-<-<four in the morning>->->-> might be considered wacky. Nobody did that in Sylvan except one or two dedicated runners during their cooldowns, and she wasn’t a runner."
"Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> train."
"She lay down at <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->, not expecting to sleep a wink, but her healing body had its own priorities. She went under almost instantly, and when she woke to the insistent 𝘥𝘢𝘩-𝘥𝘢𝘩-𝘥𝘢𝘩 of her bedside clock, she was glad she had set the alarm. Outside, a gusty October breeze was combing leaves from the trees and sending them across her backyard in colorful skitters. The light had gone that strange and depthless gold which seems the exclusive property of late-fall afternoons in New England."
"𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 came in the form of a bright green van, Sunday morning, <-<-<-<4:00 A.M.>->->-> sharp. Dervla awoke to acrid exhaust fumes billowing into her open bedroom window. Annoyance turned to gratitude when she spotted the peculiar vehicle, for Dervla knew a juicy bit of news when she saw one."
"Nothing happened, he said wanly. ""I waited, and about <-<-<-<four o'clock>->->-> she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light."""
"I looked at the clock and it was (yes, you guessed it) <-<-<-<four am.>->->-> I should have taken comfort from the fact that approximately quarter of the Greenwich Mean Time world had just jolted awake also and were lying, staring miserably into the darkness, worrying."
"Suddenly, he started to cry. Curled up on the sofa he sobbed loudly. Michel looked at his watch; it was just after <-<-<-<4 am>->->->. On the screen a wild cat had a rabbit in its mouth."
The Birds begun at <-<-<-<Four o'clock>->->-><br>Their period for Dawn
"The night before Albert Kessler arrived in Santa Teresa, <-<-<-<at four>->->-> in the morning, Sergio Gonzalez Rodriguez got a call from Azucena Esquivel Plata, reporter and PRI congresswoman."
"Waking <-<-<-<at four>->->-> to soundless dark, I stare. In time the curtain-edges will grow light. Till then I see what's really always there: Unresting death, a whole day nearer now, Making all thought impossible but how And where and when I shall myself die."
"When he noticed that the chefs from the grand hotels and restaurants - a picky, impatient bunch - tended to move around from seller to seller, buying apples here and broccoli there, he asked if he could have tea available for them. Tommy agreed, and the chefs, grateful for a hot drink <-<-<-<at four>->->-> in the morning, lingered and bought."
"It was now <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> of a midsummer morning, and the western hills, that I could see through a hall window, began to be impurpled by reflection from the opposite horizon of the dawn."
"In a moment I had the office and the night editor’s desk, had told him who I was, and began to dictate. “At <-<-<-<one minute past four>->->-> by our time (see what time Paris time is for that, and put it in) a French battleship was sunk by the man who is to stop all war. Probably no one on board escaped.” That last was a guess based on the experience of the past."
Charlie glanced at the clock. <-<-<-<Barely past four a.m.>->->-> at home. Sunday. She'd be up. Probably reading over a cup of coffee before taking a run before church.
"Suddenly, he started to cry. Curled up on the sofa he sobbed loudly. Michel looked at his watch; it was <-<-<-<just after 4 am>->->->. On the screen a wild cat had a rabbit in its mouth."
I walked up and down the row. No one gave me a second look. Finally I sat down next to a man. He paid no attention. My watch said <-<-<-<4:02>->->->. Maybe he was late.
It’s <-<-<-<4:03 a.m.>->->-> on a supremely cold January morning and I’m just getting home. I’ve been out dancing and I’m only half drunk but utterly exhausted.
"<-<-<-<Four minutes after four!>->->-> It's still very early and to get from here to there won't take me more than 15 minutes, even walking slowly. She told me around five o'clock. Wouldn't it be better to wait on the corner?"
"Leaves were being blown against my window. It was <-<-<-<4.05 am>->->->. The moon had shifted in the sky, glaring through a clotted mass of clouds like a candled egg."
"Dexter looked at Kate's note, then her face, then the clock. It was <-<-<-<4.06 am>->->->, the night before they would go to the restaurant."
"<-<-<-<4.07 am>->->->. Why am I standing? My shoulders feel cold and I'm shivering. I become aware that I'm standing in the middle of the room. I immediately look at the bedroom door. Closed, with no signs of a break-in. Why did I get up?"
It was at <-<-<-<4:08 a.m.>->->-> beneath the cool metal of a jungle gym that all Andrew's dreams came true. He kissed his one true love and swore up and down that it would last forever to this exhausted companion throughout their long trek home.
"“The truck has driven nonstop through the night at a steady pace of around forty miles per hour in the direction of Baghdad, but at <-<-<-<4:09>->->-> this morning it turned off into the desert, and we ceased to monitor its movements, as that particular path leads nowhere."
"It was <-<-<-<nine minutes past four>->->->. ""He's sitting in the middle of an ultrasonic field and I'm ten minutes late to get him out. Come on!"""
"I don't like this waiting, he said.<br>She smiled. ""You'd make a terrible PI.""<br>""What time is it?""<br>""<-<-<-<Four-ten>->->->. Fifteen minutes later than the last time you asked."""
"The change came at <-<-<-<four-ten>->->->. Lying on the sand, the woman in the black suit saw it coming and relaxed."
"The next morning I awaken at exactly <-<-<-<eleven minutes after four>->->->, having slept straight through my normal middle-of-the-night insomniac waking at three."
"Finally, she signalled with her light that she'd made it to the top. I signalled back, then shined the light downward to see how far the water had risen. I couldn't make out a thing. My watch read <-<-<-<four-twelve>->->-> in the morning. Not yet dawn. The morning papers still not delivered, trains not yet running, citizens of the surface world fast asleep, oblivious to all this. I pulled the rope taut with both hands, took a deep breath, then slowly began my climb."
"Karen felt the bed move beneath Harry's weight. Lying on her side she opened her eyes to see digital numbers in the dark, <-<-<-<4:12>->->-> in pale green. Behind her Harry continued to move, settling in. She watched the numbers change to 4:13."
"Karen felt the bed move beneath Harry's weight. Lying on her side she opened her eyes to see digital numbers in the dark, 4:12 in pale green. Behind her Harry continued to move, settling in. She watched the numbers change to <-<-<-<4:13>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<4:14 a.m.>->->->, the two men returned to the Jeep. After the passenger replaced the cans in the back of the Jeep, the driver backed out of the driveway and headed east. The last images found on the film appeared to be flames or smoke."
"Alice wants to warn her that a defect runs in the family, like flat feet or diabetes: they're all in danger of ending up alone by their own stubborn choice. The ugly kitchen clock says <-<-<-<four-fifteen>->->->."
"I stooped to pick up my watch from the floor. <-<-<-<Four-sixteen>->->->. Another hour until dawn. I went to the telephone and dialled my own number. It'd been a long time since I'd called home, so I had to struggle to remember the number. I let it ring fifteen times; no answer. I hung up, dialled again, and let it ring another fifteen times. Nobody."
They pulled into the visitor's carpark at <-<-<-<four sixteen>->->-> am. He knew it was four sixteen because the entrance to the maternity unit sported a digital clock beneath the signage.
"Big Al stretched and began to walk slowly around the car. He knew they planned to leave long before first light, which was at 6:48 A.M. He checked his watch: <-<-<-<4:17>->->->. They both looked up when a plane flew overhead, the first to land at Heathrow that morning."
"I succumbed to my curiosity, tugged up the left sleeve of my pullover, and checked my wristwatch. It was <-<-<-<4:17 a.m.>->->-> This surprised me not because it was almost dawn, but because I’d had no idea of the time whatsoever."
"He awoke at <-<-<-<4.17 am>->->-> in a sweat. He had been dreaming of Africa again, and then the dream had continued in the U.S. when he was a young man. But Inbata had been there, watching him."
"I grabbed the alarm clock, threw it on my lap, and slapped the red and black buttons with both hands. The ringing didn't stop. The telephone! The clock read <-<-<-<four-eighteen>->->->. It was dark outside. Four-eighteen a.m. I got out of bed and picked up the receiver. ""Hello?"""
"At <-<-<-<nineteen minutes past four>->->-> on the morning of December 27, 2040, her eyes, dark as an Aztec sacrificial knife, flicked open."
"At each waking he switched on the light and glanced at his bedside clock, hoping to find that dawn was near to breaking. Two-ten, three-forty, <-<-<-<four-twenty>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<twenty-one past four>->->-> I inferred that the initial hostilities had not damaged its works. It was running, and I didn't know whether to interpret this indifference on the part of Time as a good or bad omen."
The chairman dialed seven digits and asked to speak to the duty officer. He checked his watch as he waited to be put through. It was <-<-<-<4:22>->->->.
He hurt me to the point where I wanted to tell him something. My watch said <-<-<-<4.22>->->-> now. It had stopped. It was smashed.
"<-<-<-<4:23>->->->, Monday morning, Iceland Square. A number of people in the vicinity of Bjornsongatan are awakened by loud screams."
Her chip pulsed the time. <-<-<-<04:23>->->->:04. It had been a long day.
"At <-<-<-<04:24>->->-> on January 5, 2025, the stars stood still in the sky. In California, the earthquake started with a low-frequency rumble. It wasn't a sound but a sensation that caused an incomprehensible weakness in the legs, a constriction of the bowels, and panic."
As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was <-<-<-<twenty-five minutes past four>->->->.
"At <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes past four>->->->, she was pronounced dead. Cause of death, or rather manner of death, was apparent. There were two bullet wounds of entry in her chest."
And then I heard the school bell in my dream but it wasn't really a school bell and the pitch went very steep like a trap door opening and I fell and landed in my bed. It was still dark and my alarm clock said <-<-<-<04:27>->->-> and I heard the noise again.
He had been the only survivor - the only one who'd come home alive. So what the hell was going on? Who was this new character in his nightmares? He glanced up at the clock and was disheartened to discover that it was only <-<-<-<0428>->->-> hours.
"Your pardon, Dr. Leving, but there is an urgent call for you. The pseudo-robot Caliban says he must speak with you at once.<br>Fredda sighed. She knew she had to take the call, and that Caliban would only call if it were important. But even so, it was turning into a very long night.<br>""Now what time is it?"" she asked.<br>""It is now <-<-<-<0429 hours>->->->,"" Donald said."
"He cannot leave.<br>Most likely, he’ll never leave.<br>Bram finds his way back to the chair and settles in.<br>Outside, a bird cries out as the moon comes and goes behind thick clouds. He retrieves the pocket watch from his coat and curses. He forgot to wind it, and the hands ceased their journey at <-<-<-<4:30>->->->. He stuffs it back into his pocket."
"What has happened to me? Why am I so alone in the world? <-<-<-<4:30 A.M.>->->->—The solution came to me, just as I was dozing off. Illuminated! Everything fits together, and I see what I should have known from the beginning. No more sleep. I’ve got to get back to the lab and test this against the results from the computer. This, finally, is the flaw in the experiment. I’ve found it."
"Algernon died two days ago. I found him at <-<-<-<four thirty in the morning>->->-> when I came back to the lab after wandering around down at the waterfront—on his side, stretched out in the corner of his cage. As if he were running in his sleep."
"Jonas rolls painfully out of the hammock, his aching lower back stiff and swollen, in desperate need of a chiropractor. He checks his watch. <-<-<-<Four thirty>->->->…but is it a.m. or p.m.?"
"𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘸𝘩𝘺 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘣𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 “𝘤𝘺𝘤𝘭𝘦”?<br>If you wish. A server is woken at hour <-<-<-<four-thirty>->->-> by stimulin in the airflow, then yellow-up in our dormroom. After a minute in the hygiener and steamer, we put on fresh uniforms before filing into the restaurant."
"“What time is it? Do you have time here?”<br>“Of course we do.” She pulled up her sleeve, revealing a yellow Timex wristwatch. “It is <-<-<-<four thirty in the morning>->->->.”<br>“That’s a nice watch.”<br>“My father gave it to me,” she said happily."
"At the end of a relationship, it is the one who is not in love who makes the tender speeches. I was overwhelmed by a sense of betrayal, betrayal because a union in which I had invested so much had been declared bankrupt without my feeling it to be so. Chloe had not given it a chance, I argued with myself, knowing the hopelessness of these inner courts announcing hollow verdicts at <-<-<-<four thirty>->->-> in the morning."
"Hester Thrale undulates in in a false fox jacket at 2330 as usual even though she has to be up at like <-<-<-<0430>->->-> for the breakfast shift at the Provident Nursing Home and sometimes eats breakfast with Gately, both their faces nodding perilously close to their Frosted Flakes."
"As Miss Nichol walked along the corridor, she checked her watch. It was <-<-<-<4:31 A.M.>->->-> She took the stairs down to the fifth floor and made her way to the nursery."
An earthquake hit Los Angeles at <-<-<-<4:31>->->-> this morning and the images began arriving via CNN right away.
"On his first day of kindergarten, Peter Houghton woke up at <-<-<-<4:32 a.m.>->->-> He padded into his parents' room and asked if it was time yet to take the school bus."
"When he heard the faint clunk of a steel gate closing behind them, he smiled in the darkness. They were out. He pressed a button on the watch and when the light showed him it was <-<-<-<04.33>->->-> his smile became a grin. No one had made it out of Greenacres for over a decade, which made Bishop's achievement that much sweeter. That was the kind of record he liked to beat."
"He was not pleased about being pulled out of his dream. The clock taunted him, saying it was <-<-<-<4:34 AM>->->->. He picked up the receiver."
"With a heavy sigh, I pried open my eyes just enough to focus on the numbers glowing atop my nightstand. It was <-<-<-<4:34 A.M.>->->-> What kind of sadist called another human being at 4:34 in the morning?"
No manner of exhaustion can keep a child asleep much later than six a.m. on Christmas Day. Colby awoke at <-<-<-<4:35>->->->.
"At <-<-<-<4:36>->->-> that morning, alone in my hotel room, it had been a much better scene. Spencer had blanched, confounded by the inescapable logic of my accusation. A few drops of perspiration had formed on his upper lip. A tiny vein had started to throb in his temple."
"The knock at the door was soft, but it still awoke Stephen. He touched the screen on his smartphone. <-<-<-<4:37 AM>->->->"
"Her bedroom was hardly any bigger than her king-size mattress, which she’d told me she’d inherited from her parents when her mother got sick “and so they got two doubles because my dad couldn’t sleep at night with all her fidgeting.” Green numbers on a digital alarm clock glowed between cans of Diet 7UP on the bedside table. It was <-<-<-<4:37>->->->. I smelled peanut butter and again, the bitter tang of vomit."
"At <-<-<-<4.38 a.m.>->->-> as the sun is coming up over Gorley Woods, I hear a strange rustling in the grass beside me. I peer closely but can see nothing."
"At zero hour minus one minute, <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes to five>->->-> on March the twenty-first, Jiffy Tripp stood in the tranches beside an infantry officer, looking over no man's land. It was still dark. At zero hour plus five seconds the shell bursts actually threw a sort of witch's kaleidoscope onto no man's land, and he was reaching for the SOS rockets. Red - green - red."
"I settled into a daily routine. Wake up at <-<-<-<4.40 am>->->->, shower, get on the train north by ten after five."
At <-<-<-<4:41>->->-> Crane's voice crackled through the walkie-talkie as if he'd read their thoughts of mutiny. “Everyone into the elevator. Now!” Only moments before the call he and C.J. had finished what they hoped would be a successful diversion.
"A large clock above the desks read <-<-<-<04:42 am>->->->. He paused to listen. Whatever had happened there, appeared to be over."
The time is <-<-<-<four forty-three>->->-> in the mornin an it's almost light oot there.
"At <-<-<-<0444 hours>->->-> yesterday morning, the landing craft Orpheus was appropriated by Dr. Diana Chandler, twenty-seven, an astrophysicist from Toronto, Canada. Dr. Chandler, apparently disconsolate over the failure of her husband, Aaron Rossman, also twenty-seven, also of Toronto, to renew their recently expired two-year marriage contract, presumably committed suicide. Mr. Rossman is the Starcology's dock master."
"He never found it necessary to phone the Prime Minister, although Mr. Churchill did phone him on one occasion. It was <-<-<-<four forty-five>->->-> in the morning when Charlie picked up the receiver on his desk."
"His wife's breathing at his side is so faint that he can scarcely hear it. One of these mornings she'll be lying dead beside me and I won't even notice, he thinks. Or maybe it'll be me. Daybreak will reveal that one of us has been left alone. He checks the clock on the table next to the bed. The hands glow and register <-<-<-<4:45 a.m.>->->->"
"The phone rang again at <-<-<-<four-forty-six>->->->.<br>""Hello,"" I said.<br>""Hello,"" came a woman's voice. ""Sorry about the time before. There's a disturbance in the sound field. Sometimes the sound goes away.""<br>""The sound goes away?""<br>""Yes,"" she said. ""The sound field's slipping. Can you hear me?"""
"I slept only fitfully after looking online. The phrases I’d read repeated in my head over and over again. When I woke up for what felt like the hundredth time, the Stormtrooper clock beside the bed read <-<-<-<4.47 am>->->->."
At <-<-<-<4:48>->->-> the happy hour when clarity visits warm darkness which soaks my eyes I know no sin
"Thinking about the card warms me to the idea of walking under the arched doorway of the Newtons' home, but when I arrive at their house, the plan seems ridiculous. What am I doing? It's <-<-<-<4:48 a.m.>->->->, and I'm parked outside their darkened house."
When Costain left the bridge the brass chromometer in the wheelhouse said <-<-<-<eleven minutes to five>->->->. Harkness looked at it and realised vaguely that the gap was still too big.
"Even the hands of his watch and the hands of all the thirteen clocks were frozen. They had all frozen at the same time, on a snowy night, seven years before, and after that it was always <-<-<-<ten minutes to five>->->-> in the castle."
"<-<-<-<4:51 A.M.>->->-><br>""You know, I hate to spoil all the fun you're having."" Vance tried to look at Moreau, but he could barely see through the swelling of his puffy eyelids. ""But I've got some unsettling news. You and the rest of Ramirez's hoods are about to be in a deep situation here. The minute you try to send that bomb up, you can tip your hat and kiss your ass good-bye. Better enjoy this while you can."""
"Earlier? It's <-<-<-<nine minutes to five a.m.>->->-> - who would be up this early?<br>""Oh, we're all early risers."""
"Anna left the apartment at <-<-<-<4:52 A.M.>->->->, dressed in jeans, a blue T-shirt, a linen jacket, and a baseball cap. She wasn’t sure what to expect as she stepped out onto the sidewalk that cool, dark morning."
"If it matters, it's <-<-<-<eight minutes to five>->->->. Don't get any persecuted ideas that I enjoy being out of bed at this time of night. It makes it legally easier if you invite us in."
It was so quiet in the post office that Trinidad could hear the soft tick of the clock's second hand every time it moved. It was now <-<-<-<seven minutes before five>->->->.
When the last lid had been placed back on he checked the clock on the wall: <-<-<-<six minutes to five>->->->. Just enough time to glance in the other box and see if he could expect the same again.
"<-<-<-<Six minutes to five>->->->. Six minutes to go. Suddenly I felt quite clearheaded. There was an unexpected light in the cell; the boundaries were drawn, the roles well defined. The time of doubt and questioning and uncertainty was over."
"There were two messages. The first, sent at <-<-<-<4:55 a.m.>->->->, was from the campus garage.<br>""We have your vehicle,"" the mechanic's voice informed him. ""Unfortunately, we had some trouble getting it out of the ditch, and it has sustained a small amount of additional damage."""
"<-<-<-<4:55>->->-> - Mank holding phone. Turns to Caddell - ""Who is this?""<br>Caddell: ""Jim."" (shrugs) ""I think he's our man in Cincinnati."""
"Trying to identify the key facts, Ethan was suddenly aware he was looking at the wall clock; it was 7:35.<br>“Wait a minute. When did you hear about this?”<br>There was a tiny moment of hesitation. “The first news came in <-<-<-<just before five>->->->.”"
"“That's it. At <-<-<-<four minutes to five>->->-> by yours. Seven to, by mine.”<br>It was the cuirassier who remained by the side of General D'Hubert, keeping his one eye fixed immovably on the white face of the watch he held in the palm of his hand. He opened his mouth wide, waiting for the beat of the last second, long before he snapped out the word:<br>“Avancez!”"
"One hundred and thirty-one seconds were lost at Elkhart in changing locomotives, and it was <-<-<-<three minutes to five>->->-> when big 599, with Dave Luce in the cab, turned her nose toward the dawning day and started for Toledo, 133 miles away."
"It was not until they had swept through the village, over the bridge, and were out on the broad highway toward Chester that Ruth began to realize what a wild goose chase she had undertaken. Just where did she expect to find them, anyway? It was now <-<-<-<three minutes to five>->->-> by the little clock in the car and it was a full fifteen minutes' drive to Chester."
"The second said the same thing a <-<-<-<few minutes before five>->->->, and mentioned eternity... I'm sure I'll meet you in the other world. Four minutes later she left a last, fleeting message: My love. Fernando. It's Suzana. Then, it seemed, she had shot herself."
"He wants to look death in the face. <-<-<-<Two minutes to five>->->->. I took a handkerchief out of my pocket, but John Dawson ordered me to put it back. An Englishman dies with his eyes open. He wants to look death in the face."
"The captain and his three mates appeared out of the early morning mist at <-<-<-<one minute to five>->->->. All four of them were dressed in exactly the same clothes they had been wearing the night before, making Percy wonder if they’d come straight from the Fisherman’s Arms."
The whole place smells like death no matter what the fuck you do. Gately gets to the shelter at <-<-<-<0459>->->->.9h and just shuts his head off as if his head had a control switch.
"At precisely <-<-<-<5 o’clock>->->->, like every morning, hours before a single stirring would emerge from the rooms upstairs, Dora dragged herself from her bed and made her way down the hallway to the kitchen, where she put on a kettle and dropped a bag of Earl Grey in a mug."
"“I just took all the pills in the bathroom cabinet,” she says. “Sixty-two aspirin with codeine, twenty-four Valiums. I thought you might like to say goodbye.”<br>“That was stupid, Martha,” Nate says. “Did you really?”<br>“Wait and see,” she says, laughing. “Wait till <-<-<-<five in the morning>->->-> when you get to inspect the body.”"
Soft yellow light came through the side windows. It was morning: he had slept the whole night! He looked quickly at his watch: <-<-<-<5:00 A.M.>->->-> Still almost six hours to go before the boat had to be recalled.
Muldoon scowled. “The electrified fences were off?”<br>“Yes.”<br>“All of them? Since <-<-<-<five>->->-> this morning? For the last five hours?”<br>“Yes.”
THE HAMMER BANGED reveille on the rail outside camp HQ at <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> as always. Time to get up. The ragged noise was muffled by ice two fingers thick on the windows and soon died away. Too cold for the warder to go on hammering.
According to Leon … the day after tomorrow. The attack is scheduled for the day after tomorrow at about <-<-<-<five o’clock in the morning>->->->. His face was still in shadow.
"Sixsmith,<br>Sitting at my escritoire in my dressing gown. The church bell chimes <-<-<-<five>->->->. Another thirsty dawn. My candle is burnt away. A tiring night turned inside out."
"<-<-<-<Five o’clock>->->-> had hardly struck on the morning of the nineteenth of January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed."
"They had been up since <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> that morning, as the reader will remember; but bah! there is no such thing as fatigue on Sunday, said Favourite; on Sunday fatigue does not work."
"My grandfather Arthur once took me fishing. I was seven.<br>I suppose he must have gone fishing frequently, although I never recall him bringing back any fish, nor indeed, any other fishing trips.<br>He woke me up at <-<-<-<five>->->->, before the sun was up."
"Thursday morning. The day of. Billy gets up at <-<-<-<five>->->->. He eats toast with a glass of water to wash it down. No coffee. No caffeine of any kind until the job is done. When he shoulders the 700 and looks through the Leupold scope, he wants his hands perfectly steady."
"Not even a yawn. I wasn’t remotely sleepy. I could tell my sense of balance was off—I nearly fell over when I tried to stand up, but I pushed through it and tidied up for a while, sliding the videocassettes into their cases and putting them back on the shelf. I thought some activity might tire me out. I took a Zyprexa and some more Ativan. I ate a handful of melatonin, chewing like a cow on cud. Nothing was working.<br>So I called Trevor.<br>“It’s <-<-<-<five in the morning>->->->,” he said. He sounded irritated and foggy, but he’d answered."
"Sixsmith,<br>Shot myself through the roof of my mouth at <-<-<-<five A.M.>->->-> this morning with V.A.‘s Luger. But I saw you, my dear, dear fellow! How touched I am that you care so much! On the belfry’s lookout, yesterday, at sunset. Sheerest fluke you didn’t see me first."
"I did Danièle’s math in my head. “If we start at ten, walk for four hours, rest for one, walk for another two, that’s seven hours in total. That will take us to <-<-<-<five in the morning>->->->. Seven hours back, it won’t be noon until we resurface.”"
"The unlocked back door creaked open slowly to reveal Fiona Athey, with an apologetic look on her face, She was holding a stack of flyers under her left arm. “I hope I didn’t wake you up, now. I’ll come back another time, then. Sorry.” She turned to leave.<br>“No, stay,” Marjan replied. “I’ve been up since <-<-<-<five>->->->. Making a new batch of bread. Why don’t you come in for a cup of tea?”"
"Soon after <-<-<-<5 a.m.>->->-> he noticed the sky at its edges beginning to turn an oyster grey. Gradually the dark crests of the wooded pine hills emerged, serrated like a saw’s teeth against the spreading light, while in the valleys the white mist seemed as solid as a glacier."
"It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and hardly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside 4 miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whately was born at <-<-<-<5 a.m.>->->-> on Sunday, 2 February, 1913. The date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under another name."
"Just after <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> on this chill September morning, the fishmonger's cart, containing Kirsten and Emilia and such possessions as they have been able to assemble in the time allowed to them, is driven out of the gates of Rosenborg?"
"The cold eye of the Duke was dazzled by the gleaming of a thousand jewels that sparkled on the table. His ears were filled with chiming as the clocks began to strike. ""One!"" said Hark. ""Two!"" cried Zorn of Zorna. ""Three!"" the Duke's voice almost whispered. ""Four!"" sighed Saralinda. ""<-<-<-<Five>->->->!"" the Golux crowed, and pointed at the table. ""The task is done, the terms are met,"" he said."""
"The day came slow, till <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->->. Then sprang before the hills. Like hindered rubies, or the light. A sudden musket spills"
"There are worse things than having behaved foolishly in public. There are worse things than these miniature betrayals, committed or endured or suspected; there are worse things than not being able to sleep for thinking about them. It is <-<-<-<5 a.m.>->->-> All the worse things come stalking in and stand icily about the bed looking worse and worse and worse."
"What causes young people to ""come out,"" but the noble ambition of matrimony? What sends them trooping to watering-places? What keeps them dancing till <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> in the morning through a whole mortal season?"
"Oh yes. His clocks were set at <-<-<-<one minute past five>->->->, four minutes past five and seven minutes past five. That was the combination number of a safe, 515457. The safe was concealed behind a reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Inside the safe, continued Poirot, with distaste, ""were the Crown Jewels of the Russian Royal Family."""
"Just <-<-<-<after five o'clock>->->-> on this chill September morning, the fishmonger's cart, containing Kirsten and Emilia and such possessions as they have been able to assemble in the time allowed to them, is driven out of the gates of Rosenborg?"
"It was <-<-<-<5:02 a.m.>->->->, December 14. In another fifty-eight minutes he would set sail for America. He did not want to leave his bride; he did not want to go."
"It was <-<-<-<5:03 a.m.>->->-> It didn't matter. She wasn't going to get back to sleep. She threw off her covers and, swearing at herself, Caleb and Mr. Griffin, she headed into the shower."
"I looked down at the watch Trey had given me last Christmas, the delicate gold links so real and solid, and it seemed like someone else’s memory strapped to someone else’s shaking hand. It was <-<-<-<5:03>->->-> now. I was halfway to my house."
"Oh yes. His clocks were set at one minute past five, <-<-<-<four minutes past five>->->-> and seven minutes past five. That was the combination number of a safe, 515457. The safe was concealed behind a reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Inside the safe, continued Poirot, with distaste, ""were the Crown Jewels of the Russian Royal Family."""
<-<-<-<5.04 a.m.>->->-> on the substandard clock radio. Because why do people always say the day starts now? Really it starts in the middle of the night at a fraction of a second past midnight.
"The baby, a boy, is born at <-<-<-<five past five>->->-> in the morning."
"<-<-<-<5:06 a.m.>->->-> I wake up strangely energized, my stomach growling. Upstairs, the overstocked fridge offers me its bounty of sympathy food."
"He blinked, turned over, and stared at the fluorescent green figures on his bedside clock: <-<-<-<5:07>->->->. More than enough time to go over the opening lines in his mind before getting up."
"‘Was the time of that call recorded?’ demanded the Hawk.<br>‘Yes, sir. At <-<-<-<5.07>->->->. I called back just after nine and told Dr Redwood he could visit his patient in the prison hospital at his convenience, and carry out a full examination. He did so later that morning.’"
"Oh yes. His clocks were set at one minute past five, four minutes past five and <-<-<-<seven minutes past five>->->->. That was the combination number of a safe, 515457. The safe was concealed behind a reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Inside the safe, continued Poirot, with distaste, ""were the Crown Jewels of the Russian Royal Family."""
"Ambrose and I will marry at Fort McHenry at <-<-<-<5:08>->->-> EDST this coming Saturday, Rosh Hashanah!"
"“You’ll have one by the side of your bed in a few years’ time, so you wouldn’t even need to go into your office,” said Su Ling, letting her head fall back on the pillow when she saw <-<-<-<5:09>->->-> flick up on the bedside clock."
"The primal flush of triumph which had saturated the American's humor on this signal success, proved but fictive and transitory when inquiry of the station attendants educed the information that the two earliest trains to be obtained were the <-<-<-<5:09>->->-> to Dunkerque and the 5:37 for Ostend."
"Oh, my husband, I have done the deed which will relieve you of the wife whom you hate! I have taken the poison--all of it that was left in the paper packet, which was the first that I found. If this is not enough to kill me, I have more left in the bottle. <-<-<-<Ten minutes past five>->->->."
"I settled into a daily routine. Wake up at 4:40 am, shower, get on the train north by <-<-<-<ten after five>->->->."
"Today was Tuesday, the fifteenth of August; the sun had risen at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past five>->->-> this morning and would set at two minutes before seven this evening."
"At <-<-<-<twelve minutes and six seconds past five o'clock>->->-> on the morning of April 18th, 1906, the San Francisco peninsula began to shiver in the grip of an earthquake which, when its ultimate consequences are considered, was the most disastrous in the recorded history of the North American continent."
"Wu said, “You shut down at <-<-<-<five-thirteen>->->-> this morning, and when you started back up, you started with auxiliary power.”"
"Lying on my side in bed, I stared at my alarm clock until it became a blemish, its red hue glowing like a welcome sign beckoning me into the depths of hell's crimson-colored cavities. <-<-<-<5:13 am>->->->. To describe this Monday as a blue Monday was an understatement."
"The time was <-<-<-<5.14 am>->->->, a very strange time indeed for the sheriff to have seen what he claimed he saw as he made his early-morning rounds, first patrolling back and forth along the deserted, snowbound streets of Kingdom City before extending his vigilance northward, along County Road."
"By the first week of May, Ralph was waking up to birdsong at <-<-<-<5:15 a.m.>->->-> He tried earplugs for a few nights, although he doubted from the outset that they would work. It wasn’t the newly returned birds that were waking him up, nor the occasional delivery-truck backfire out on Harris Avenue. He had always been the sort of guy who could sleep in the middle of a brass marching bad, and he didn’t think that had changed. What had changed was inside his head."
"Weird conversation with Brown, a tired & confused old man who's been jerked out of bed at <-<-<-<5:15>->->->."
"<-<-<-<5:16>->->-> - Mank on phone to Secretary of State Brown: 'Mr. Brown, we're profoundly disturbed about this situation in the 21st. We can't get a single result out of there."
"She could go back to sleep. But typical and ironic, she is completely awake. It is completely light outside now; you can see for miles. Except there is nothing to see here; trees and fields and that kind of thing. <-<-<-<5:16 a.m>->->-> on the substandard clock radio. She is really awake."
"After managing to get roughly three hours of sleep, Grant checked the time on his phone. <-<-<-<5:17 AM>->->->.<br>More sleep is unlikely. Time for a morning run."
WILLIAM PICKED UP THE PHONE but didn’t turn on the light as the digital clock on his bedside table turned from 5:17 to <-<-<-<5:18>->->->. He knew it could only be one person on the other end of the line.
"The story is there, and the security photo that runs with it is pretty damning. An hour earlier the light wouldn’t have been good enough to show the doer’s face, but the time stamp on the bottom of the photo is <-<-<-<5:18 AM>->->->. The sun isn’t up but it’s getting there, and the face of the guy standing in the alley is as clear as you’d want, if you were a prosecutor."
ABOARD TPA 545<br><-<-<-<5:18 A.M.>->->-><br>Emily Jansen sighed in relief. The long flight was nearing an end. Morning sunlight streamed through the windows of the airplane.
Scott eased himself into the corner before once again checking the little sulphur dots on his watch. It was <-<-<-<5:19>->->->. He and Hannah had been in the safe for an hour and seventeen minutes.
"<-<-<-<5:19 A.M.>->->-><br>She heaved a sigh of relief as she put down the microphone and prepared to stumble down the hill. She realized she had violated protocol by breaking radio silence, but she was almost as worried about Michael Vance as she was about the facility."
"If she can keep her speed to seventy until she leaves the turnpike at midtown, and if she catches most of the traffic lights, she estimates she can be at her building by <-<-<-<five-twenty>->->->."
"He saw on the floor his cigarette reduced to a long thin cylinder of ash: it had smoked itself. It was <-<-<-<five twenty>->->->, dawn was breaking behind the shed of empty barrels, the thermometer pointed to 210 degrees."
"On the morning of the ninth instant, that is to say, yesterday, at <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes past five o'clock in the morning>->->->, P.C. Whitstable was proceeding upon his usual beat and had reached the corner of Clarges Street and Piccadilly, when he heard a shout on the other side of the road, at the point where a path exits from The Green Park."
"Yes, she nodded. ""I will take off in the dark, and be over Tuti airfield at sunrise. That's at <-<-<-<05.22 hours>->->->."""
"Tock wagged his tail proudly, but Milo didn’t say a word, and to this day no one knows of the lost week but the few people who happened to be awake at <-<-<-<5:23>->->-> on that very strange morning."
"If I could count precisely to sixty between two passing orange minutes on her digital clock, starting at <-<-<-<5:23>->->-> am and ending exactly as it melted into 5:24, then when she woke she would love me and not say this had been a terrible mistake."
"If I could count precisely to sixty between two passing orange minutes on her digital clock, starting at 5:23 am and ending exactly as it melted into <-<-<-<5:24>->->->, then when she woke she would love me and not say this had been a terrible mistake."
"At <-<-<-<5:25 a.m.>->->-> the doorbell rings, always an evil omen. I stagger to the intercom and push the button."
"George's train home from New Street leaves at <-<-<-<5.25>->->->. On the return journey, there are rarely schoolboys."
"I think this is actually bump number 1,970. And the boy keeps plugging away at the same speed. There isn’t a sound from them. Not a moan. Poor them. Poor me. I look at the clock. <-<-<-<05:26>->->->."
"She looked at her watch. It was <-<-<-<5.27 am>->->->. Surely Gawain would already be here? Wouldn’t he be looking out for her, since there was no obvious way of getting inside?"
I pulled into the Aoyama supermarket parking garage at <-<-<-<five-twenty-eight>->->->. The sky to the east was getting light. I entered the store carrying my bag. Almost no one was in the place. A young clerk in a striped uniform sat reading a magazine; a woman of indeterminate age was buying a cartload of cans and instant food. I turned past the liquor display and went straight to the snack bar.
"As the match burned close to his fingers, Orme pulled out his watch. It was <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes past five>->->->.<br>Darkness again.<br>Orme groped his way to the door and tugged at the handle. The door would not open; built with air-tight nicety, it did not budge in the least."
"<-<-<-<Shortly before five-thirty>->->-> Father Martin woke himself with a shriek of terror. He jerked up in bed and sat, rigid as a doll, staring wild-eyed into the darkness."
"“When they pulled out of the driveway at <-<-<-<five thirty in the morning>->->->, Emmett was in good spirits. The night before, with the help of Billy”s map, he had laid out an itinerary. The route form Morgen to San Francisco was a little over fifteen hundred miles."""
"He picks her up, places her on the bed, lies down beside her. He kisses her again, tentatively, lingeringly. Then he asks what time it is. He himself has no watch. Lesje tells him it’s <-<-<-<five-thirty>->->->. He sits up. Lesje is beginning to feel slightly unattractive. Are her teeth too large, is that it?"
"It was <-<-<-<half-past five>->->-> before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits, a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression."
"Had Thomas McGuire stopped to admire the fanfare of saffron rays, he might have missed the beginning of the end of his rule over the sleepy seaside town. But as was often the case with men of his temperament, Thomas had little time for daydreams. The obstinate businessman had charged out of his hard bed at <-<-<-<five-thirty>->->-> that morning, determined as ever to tend to his growing empire of three pubs, two spirit shops, and one inn on Main Mall."
"When Braque and her brother Randy were kids, their mom used to wake them up at <-<-<-<5:30 in the morning>->->-> for family road trips, to avoid traffic; there were safety latches around the house until she was eleven; there was no TV and sure as sh*t no candy, pop, alcohol, or smoking; she ironed bedsheets and bleached underwear and cleaned the bathrooms at least twice a day."
"Gideon has been most unlike Gideon. As Walter Eastman is preoccupied himself, he has not had time, or more to the point, inclination, to notice aberrant behaviour. For instance, it is <-<-<-<half-past five>->->-> in the summer morning. Young Chase's narrow bachelor bed has evidently been slept in, for it is rumpled in that barely disturbed way which can never be counterfeited."
"It was by this time <-<-<-<half-past five>->->->, and the sun was on the point of rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. … The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere .. the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still."
"On the day they were going to kill him, Santiago Nasar got up at <-<-<-<five-thirty>->->-> in the morning to wait for the boat the bishop was coming on."
"<-<-<-<5:31>->->-> - Mank on phone to lawyer: 'Jesus, I think we gotta go in there and get those ballots! Impound 'em! Every damn one!'"
"By <-<-<-<05.32>->->-> the driver had come back from a corner shop with a six-pack of Coke, a bottle of Jack Daniels, some sachets of breakfast milk, an armfull of stale cakes and a carton of Zhongncmhai cigarettes. The doors slammed shut and the van moved off."
It was <-<-<-<five thirty-three>->->-> when we left. Is it six o'clock now? Six thirty? And Mark's still in his cage and I'm scared to drive very fast. . . what if we don't get there in time?
"I asked ""What time is sunrise?”<br>A second's silence while the crestfallen Bush absorbed his rebuke, and then another voice answered: ""<-<-<-<Five-thirty-four>->->->, sir."""
"At five-thirty. I was here about <-<-<-<four minutes later>->->->. Judging by the appearance of the blood and the beginning of rigor in the side of the face, I guessed that he had been dead about five hours."
"The Senator woke at <-<-<-<5:35>->->-> in a cold sweat—not that he had really slept for more than a few minutes at any one time. It had been an evil night, thunder and lightning and sirens."
"He was surprised to see it was <-<-<-<5:35>->->->. So he must have slept - or at least dozed - for over six hours. He was beginning to wonder whether the storm had really spent its force when the moaning began again, and rose to another howling crescendo."
"<-<-<-<5:35>->->-> - All phones ringing now, the swing shift has shot the gap - now the others are waking up."
"I squinted at the clock. 'It says <-<-<-<twenty-five before six>->->->,' I said and rolled away from him."
"At <-<-<-<5:35>->->->, he got word over the radio that Helmunth Hanover of the Aurora Sentinel had received a call from an anonymous spokesperson for the Minnesota Civilian Brigade threatening some form of retaliation if the Indians fished."
She drank a bottle of Jack Daniels. When she woke at <-<-<-<05.36>->->-> she had wiped the previous evening.
"Richard glanced at the clock on the microwave - <-<-<-<5:37>->->-> - almost twelve hours, almost one half-day since he'd dialed 911."
"Good morning, Johnny, said the ship. ""It is <-<-<-<5.38 a.m.>->->->""<br>""What?"" said Johnny. ""It’s Saturday.""<br>""I told you he wouldn’t like it,"" said Sol, presumably to Kovac.<br>""It’s hardly a matter of likes or dislikes,"" said the computer. ""I have information I deem important enough to pass on at the earliest opportunity – whatever time it is."""
"George took his phone from the dressing table. ""The nightmare beat the alarm by just over an hour,"" he said. ""It's <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes to six>->->->."""
"At <-<-<-<5:40 a.m.>->->->, he threw back the duvet, swung his legs out of bed, and placed his feet firmly on the carpet."
Robert Townsend woke before the alarm sounded and lay listening in the dark. Something had disturbed his sleep - a noise outside. A distant but distinct crack. He glanced at the hands of the clock on the nightstand. <-<-<-<Twenty to six>->->->. Crack. Crack. Crack. There it was again. What on earth could it be?
"<-<-<-<Twenty minutes to six>->->->. 'Rob's boys were already on the platform, barrows ready. The only thing that ever dared to be late around here was the train. Rob's boys were in fact Bill Bing, thirty, sucking a Woodbine, and Arthur, sixty, half dead."
"It took Inigo until <-<-<-<5:41>->->-> before he actually cornered the Count. In the billiard room. “Hello,” he was about to say. “My name name is Inigo Montoya; you killed my father; prepare to die.”"
"At <-<-<-<eighteen minutes to six>->->->, they blew the wall, and even then, it was almost too late."
"On 16 July 1921 Daphne woke at <-<-<-<five forty-three>->->-> feeling drained, but by the time she stepped out into the sunshine in Lowndes Square at one forty-five she was exhilarated and actually looking forward to the occasion."
"<-<-<-<05:43>->->-> Greenwich Mean Time<br>William was woken by the phone ringing. He grabbed it, wondering who could possibly be calling him at that hour of the morning. He hoped it was Beth."
"It’s <-<-<-<5:43>->->->. Time is racing, racing."
<-<-<-<5.43>->->-> - Mank on phone to 'Mary' in Washington; 'It now appears quite clear that we'll lead the state - without the 21st.'
"And what time, again, did the defendant actually say these words?<br>""That would have been - you can see the time on the film tape on the frame where you've stopped it. <-<-<-<0544 hours>->->->."""
“But it is time to go to bed: it is a <-<-<-<quarter to six>->->-> already.”<br>And indeed it was already beginning to dawn: the young men emptied their glasses and then took leave of each other.
"“A <-<-<-<quarter to six>->->->,” answered the midwife.<br>“And what if I really am dying?” thought Olga Mihalovna, looking at her husband’s head and the window-panes on which the rain was beating."
"At <-<-<-<5:45>->->-> the following morning, the General was standing outside George’s tent in full dress uniform, carrying a black leather attaché case."
"At <-<-<-<5:45>->->-> a power-transformer on a pole beside the abandoned Tracker Brothers’ Truck Depot exploded in a flash of purple light, spraying twisted chunks of metal onto the shingled roof."
"Herbert could feel nothing. He wrote a legal-sounding phrase to the effect that the sentence had been carried out at <-<-<-<5.46 am>->->->, adding, 'without a snag'. The burial party had cursed him quietly as they'd hacked at the thick roots and tight soil."
"It was a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the sitting-room to eleven minutes past ten; those of the carriage clock on the bookshelf to <-<-<-<fourteen minutes to six>->->->. In other words, it was exactly eight; and Mrs. Hignett acknowledged the fact by moving her head on the pillow, opening her eyes, and sitting up in bed. She always woke at eight precisely."
"His eyelids pried open. The bedside lamp was lit. Rue hovered over him, flicking her finger at his earlobe. What the hell? The clock said it was <-<-<-<forty-seven minutes past five>->->->. Before dawn. On a Sunday."
"A Bacardi mirror with fogged glass hangs above the backbar next to a St. Pauli Girl clock, the clock's hands frozen at <-<-<-<twelve minutes to six>->->->."
"Towards morning he slept more deeply. Even so, the harsh incessant ring of the telephone woke him to instant consciousness. The illuminated dial of his travelling clock showed <-<-<-<5:49 a.m.>->->->"
It was <-<-<-<eleven minutes to six>->->->. After a moment he idly drew the center drawer of the desk out over his lap. For a moment he stared at the gun without recognition. Then he gave a yelp and leaped up. She had put it back!
"It was was <-<-<-<5:50>->->-> when he staggered from the room, heading he knew not where or for how long, but hoping only that whoever had been guiding him lately would not desert him now."
"It was <-<-<-<nine minutes to six o'clock>->->-> and an hour before dawn. The brigade was not due to move today, and so, just as they did every other day, along with every British corps in the field, the four battalions stood to arms in case of attack. Each company paraded and then marched to form with its battalion at its alarm post."
"At <-<-<-<5.52 am>->->-> paramedics from the St. Petersburg Fire Department and SunStar Medic One ambulance service responded to a medical emergency call at 12201 Ninth Street North, St. Petersburg, apartment 2210."
"The day had been specially chosen because the meteorologists had assured them that the sun would rise at <-<-<-<five fifty-three>->->-> and there would be no rain. The meteorologists would prove to be right about the sun, but as if to show their fallibility at four-eleven a steady drizzle began."
"At <-<-<-<five fifty-three>->->->, as a blood-red sun peeped over the horizon, a Verey pistol was fired and Charlie looked back to see the sky lit up behind him."
"The gate log showed he'd signed out at <-<-<-<seven minutes to six>->->-> that morning, slightly earlier than usual. Because they were conscientious employees, the spaceport immediately called the police and sent someone around to Gemma Tivon."
"This morning, the sun came up at <-<-<-<six minutes to six>->->->. There was already heavy early-morning rush-hour traffic on the Majesta Bridge. Meyer was driving. Carella was riding shotgun."
"One, two, three, four, five, six… She wound each clock in turn, three turns each, putting just enough power in the springs to get them ticking in time for Mr. Westcott’s inspection. Speaking of which…it was <-<-<-<five minutes to six>->->->. Five minutes before Mr. Westcott would arrive to inspect his clocks. Helena swallowed. She could hear footsteps thundering in the room below and the occasional exclamation from Stanley."
Billy doesn’t drive to the parking garage. The parking garage is done. At <-<-<-<five to six>->->-> he parks on Main Street a few blocks from the Gerard Tower. Plenty of curbside spaces at this hour and the sidewalk is deserted.
"It was <-<-<-<5.55 am>->->-> and raining hard when I pedalled up to the bike stand just outside the forecourt of the station and dashed inside. I raced past the bookstall, where all the placards of the Yorkshire Post (a morning paper) read 'York Horror', but also 'Terrific February Gales at Coast'."
ANNA PETRESCU TOUCHED the button on the top of her bedside clock. It glowed <-<-<-<5:56 A.M.>->->-> Another four minutes and it would have woken her with the early morning news. But not today.
"The officer with the chipped nose went over to borrow the watch of General Feraud. They bent their heads over them for a time. ""That's it. At <-<-<-<four minutes to six>->->-> by yours."""
"She smiles a bit but the next breath comes out louder like a moan. At <-<-<-<05.57>->->-> I say, “Ma, it’s nearly six,” so she gets up to make dinner but she doesn’t eat any."
"Loud crashes came from the flat below at <-<-<-<5.58>->->-> this morning, though she’d been clock-watching long before that."
Annika Giannini woke with a start. She saw that it was <-<-<-<5.58 a.m.>->->->
"Grant stepped into his office at St. Mary’s Lutheran Church <-<-<-<just before six>->->-> the next morning. His unusually early arrival – skipping his regular morning exercises – was spurred by a desire to pull up the essay that he had written years earlier, and to start the process of updating it, as requested."
"At <-<-<-<one minute to six>->->-> Hollis pulled out his watch. He sighed, replaced the time-piece, and leaned back in his chair. A glance out through the window showed him that the street was deserted except for here and there a cow pony drooping over one of the hitching rails and a wagon or two standing in front of a store."
The shades in the corner room on the southeast were the first to be raised. It was the old rector's bedroom. He was reading his Bible <-<-<-<before the clock had struck six>->->->.
"The next morning, Sister Veronica is still at prayer in the chapel. At <-<-<-<six>->->->, when the other sisters file in for Vigils, she is there, prostrate before the cross, her arms outstretched, her forehead touching the cold stone tile. It is only when they lean forward to touch her arm gently that the women see that the blood has settled in her face. She has been dead for many hours."
"Sammy was bright awake at <-<-<-<six>->->->, giddy with excitement, Daddy was coming, and no settling him to anything. By late morning he was climbing the walls; I suggested we go for a walk, take a little picnic. He didn’t want to leave in case Daddy came while we were gone.<br>“How ’bout we head up the hill? We can look out for him from there. Like pirates.”<br>And that did the trick."
"Monday morning. I woke at <-<-<-<six>->->-> with my head pillowed on Patrick’s chest, my knee over his thigh. I’d slept all night without surfacing once. I don’t know when I had last slept like that.<br>He got up to make coffee and we drank it in bed."
"Dan lay awake until <-<-<-<six>->->->. Then he dressed and once more made the trek to the Red Apple. This time he did not hesitate, only instead of extracting two bottles of Bird from the cooler, he took three. What was it they used to say? Go big or go home."
"The day after Olga was released from the hospital she commenced making shoes again. At <-<-<-<six in the morning>->->-> she is at her bench; she knocks out two pairs of shoes a day. Eugene complains that Olga is a burden, but the truth is that Olga is supporting Eugene and his wife with her two pairs of shoes a day. If Olga doesn’t work there is no food. So everyone endeavors to pull Olga to bed on time, to give her enough food to keep going, etc."
"Ursula invites me into the wardrobe. “You haven’t aged a day, Timbo, and neither has 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 snaky fellow!” Her furry fawn rubs up against my Narnian-sized lamppost and mothballs . . . but then, as ever, I awoke, my swollen appendage as welcome as a swollen appendix, and as useful. <-<-<-<Six o’clock>->->->. The heating systems composed works in the style of John Cage. Chillblains burned my toe knuckles. I thought about Christmases gone, so many more gone than lay ahead."
"Amazingly, the routines of everyday life lurched along as spring dissolved into flamboyant summer. Holly rose every morning at <-<-<-<six>->->->, walked and fed Buster, roused her children, made sure the youngest dressed appropriately for school, fed them, nestled lunch boxes into their backpacks, waited at the corner for the bus, waved them off."
"When she woke up, the inarguably sane light of <-<-<-<six AM>->->-> was streaming through the windows. There were things that needed to be done and decisions that needed to be made, but for the moment it was enough to be alive and in her own bed instead of stuffed into a culvert."
"“Well, good night, Pooh,” said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh’s house. “And we meet at <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> tomorrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we’ve got in our Trap.”"
"Lars watched from his living room window as the family, who must’ve left Iowa around <-<-<-<6:00 a.m.>->->-> to arrive here so early, trudged through the snow toward the lobby of his building."
"On Sunday morning he was woken at <-<-<-<six A.M.>->->-> by the telephone. It was Major Heathcote, and he got straight to the point. “What do you know about this mob at the cathedral?”"
"And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, ""he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> now."""
"What’s the time? I ask, and telling him so that he knows, ""My mother likes 'peace and quiet' to sleep late on Saturday mornings.""<br>""She does, does she? It’s <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->->. I couldn’t sleep,"" he says wearily, like an afterthought, as if it’s what he expects. ""Why are you up so early?""<br>""I woke up and needed my panda. I can’t find him."""
"But every morning, even if there's been a nighttime session and he has only slept two hours, he gets up at <-<-<-<six>->->-> and reads his paper while he drinks a strong cup of coffee. In this way Papa constructs himself every day."
"I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at <-<-<-<six a.m.>->->->"
"Lying awake in my attic room, I hear a clock strike <-<-<-<six>->->-> downstairs. It was fairly light and people were beginning to walk up and down the stairs."
"On the 15th of September 1840, about <-<-<-<six o'clock>->->-> in the morning, the Ville-de-Montereau, ready to depart, pouring out great whirls of smoke by the quai Saint-Bernard."
"The ball went on for a long time, until <-<-<-<six>->->-> in the morning; all were exhausted and wishing they had been in bed for at least three hours; but to leave early was like proclaiming the party a failure and offending the host and hostess who had taken such a lot of trouble, poor dears."
"In the image, he was looking straight up at the camera, holding a disposable cup in his hand. The time signature on the bottom right corner of the screen said that it was <-<-<-<06:01>->->-> on the same morning the two of them had come to the convent."
"Bimingham New Street 5.25. Walsall 5.55. This train does not stop at Birchills, for reasons George has never been able to ascertain. Then it is Bloxwich <-<-<-<6.02>->->->, Wyrley & Churchbridge 6.09. At 6.10 he nods to Mr. Merriman the stationmaster."
"It was still quite dark outside, and only the lower edge of the window-frame was white with snow. She could hear a low, mellow chime of bells; it was not the parish church, but somewhere further away. The watch on the little table showed <-<-<-<three minutes past six>->->->."
It was <-<-<-<four minutes past six in the morning>->->->. She shivered. She waited. She stretched because she had sat in her car for three and a half hours before the milk float had turned into the street.
"A second man went in and found the shop empty, as he thought, at <-<-<-<five minutes past six>->->->. That puts the time at between 5:30 and 6:05."
"At <-<-<-<6:06>->->->, every toilet on Merit Street suddenly exploded in a geyser of shit and raw sewage as some unimaginable reversal took place in the pipes which fed the holding tanks of the new waste-treatment plant in the Barrens."
At <-<-<-<six oh-eight a.m.>->->-> two men wearing ragged trench coats approached the Casino. The shorter of the men burst into flames.
"<-<-<-<06:09 CET>->->-><br>""Why didn't you wake me at four?"" demanded Monti. He glared down at William, who was the same color as his soaking sheet, and was still sweating."
"Bimingham New Street 5.25. Walsall 5.55. This train does not stop at Birchills, for reasons George has never been able to ascertain. Then it is Bloxwich 6.02, Wyrley & Churchbridge <-<-<-<6.09>->->->. At 6.10 he nods to Mr. Merriman the stationmaster."
"The Chairman got out of bed at 7:20 and lit his first cigarette. He couldn’t remember exactly when he had woken. At <-<-<-<6:10>->->-> he had phoned Tony, who was already up and waiting for his call."
"The bus left the station at <-<-<-<ten past six>->->-> - and she sat proud, like an accustomed traveller, apart from her father, John Henry, and Berenice. But after a while a serious doubt came in her, which even the answers of the bus-driver could not quite satisfy."
"“La Guardia,” said Dexter and then thanked the agent for sitting up half the night. Scott looked between the two front seats as the digital clock changed from <-<-<-<6:11>->->-> to 6:12."
I looked at the clock: <-<-<-<6:11 a.m.>->->-> Brittany had been gone for five hours. Time was racing forward.
"Doc Kerrison? The interrogation was surely unnecessary. Who else in this half-empty, echoing house would be answering at <-<-<-<6:12 in the morning>->->->? He made no reply and the voice went on."
"It's <-<-<-<06:13>->->->. Ma says I ought to be wrapped up in Rug already, Old Nick might possibly come."
"Virtual curtains mirrored her movement, sliding across the screen and dimming the room lighting. The red numbers <-<-<-<06:14>->->-> faded but showed in the top right hand corner."
"Father expected his shaving-water to be ready at a <-<-<-<quarter past six>->->->. Just seven minutes late, Dorothy took the can upstairs and knocked at her father's door."
It was <-<-<-<6.15 am>->->->. Just starting to get light. A small knot of older teenagers were leaning against a nearby wall. They looked as though they had been out all night.Two of the guys stared at us. Their eyes hard and threatening.
"And, as they boarded the <-<-<-<06:16>->->-> to Mittelsteine, Erika toyed with the notion that although every metre of this journey took her further from her mother it would also bring her closer to the possibility of seeing Max again and the blossoming of their new little family."
"I woke to the rain pattering at the window. I heard Josephine in the shower, the pipes clanging through the walls. The clock radio read <-<-<-<6:17 a.m.>->->-> That was when I saw our fern. It was sitting right where Josephine had first placed it, but now—it was glorious and alive. New, glossy leaves spilled up and over the pot, the front tips reaching, touching the telephone."
"Dizzy, come on. He turned slowly, coaxing the animal down on to the pillow. The clock read <-<-<-<six-seventeen>->->->. A second cat, Miles, purred on contentedly from the patch in the covers where Resnick's legs had made a deep V."
"<-<-<-<6.19 am>->->->, 8th June 2004, the jet of your pupil set in the gold of your eye."
"It was <-<-<-<6:20 a.m.>->->->, and my parents and I were standing, stunned and half-awake, in the parking lot of a Howard Johnson's in Iowa."
"The whipped mules dragged the wagon on through a flooded branch that submerged thirty yards of the road and stood up around the bushes and tree-trunks on either side so that they had no rootage, and I watched where and how deep the wheels went while I idled the motor and lighter Gudger's and my own cigarette. It was <-<-<-<twenty-one past six>->->->."
Clock overturned when he fell forward. That'll give us the time of the crime. <-<-<-<Twenty-two minutes past six>->->->.
"It was <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes past six>->->->. He actually thought about driving round and round Islington, with the radio on, shouting at it."
Eventually I track the phone down by the green light on top. Notice that the time display reads <-<-<-<06:24>->->-> before I answer. It's Mum.
"He woke with a start at <-<-<-<6:25 a.m.>->->->, a single frame in his mind."
Simon is happy to travel scum class when he's on his own and even sometimes deliberately aims for the <-<-<-<6.25>->->->. But today the .25 is delayed to 6.44.
"Still, it's your consciousness that's created it. Not somethin' just anyone could do. Others could be wanderin' around forever in who-knows-what contradictory chaos of a world. You're different. You seem t'be the immortal type.<br>""When's the turnover into that world going to take place?"" asked the chubby girl. The Professor looked at his watch. I looked at my watch. <-<-<-<Six-twenty-five>->->->. Well past daybreak. Morning papers delivered."
No lights were on in the master bedroom at this time but it is noted that the official time of sunrise for this date is <-<-<-<0626 hours>->->->. Victim is quite clear that sufficient light was entering via the large picture window to allow good visibility.
"<-<-<-<6:26 A.M.>->->-><br>""All right,"" Armont declared, ""we make the insert here."" He tapped his finger on the blueprint. ""We hit the nerve center of Launch with flash-bangs and tear gas, and take it down. If we're lucky, Ramirez will still be there, and that should be the end of it."""
"<-<-<-<6:27 A.M.>->->-><br>Eventually Mark could stand it no longer and at 6:30 A.M. he rose, showered, and put on a clean shirt and a fresh suit."
It was <-<-<-<6:27>->->->. In Frances Peverell's flat the phone rang. As soon as James spoke her name she knew that something was wrong.
"<-<-<-<06:27>->->->:52 by the chip in her optic nerve; Case had been following her progress through Villa Straylight for over an hour, letting the endorphin analogue she'd taken blot out his hangover."
"Early in the morning, late in the century, Cricklewood Broadway. At <-<-<-<0627 hours>->->-> on January 1, 1975, Alfred Archibald Jones was dressed in corduroy and sat in a fume-filled Cavalier Musketeer Estate, facedown on the steering wheel, hoping the judgment would not be too heavy upon him."
Thursday <-<-<-<6:28 A.M.>->->-><br>The morning air was sharp and she wished she'd grabbed one of Adriana's black knit shawls before going out. Could she pass for one of those stooped Greek peasant women? she wondered. Not likely. She shivered and pulled her thin coat around her.
"For the next fifteen minutes he lugged the cases of wine and beer up the stairs, constantly stopping to check his watch, and at <-<-<-<6:29>->->-> he opened the back door to find the German corporal jumping up and down and slapping his sides in an effort to keep warm."
I sat up. There was a rug over me. I threw that off and got my feet on the floor. I scowled at a clock. The clock said <-<-<-<a minute short of six-thirty>->->->.
Two whores on their way down from Portland to take us deep sea fishing in a boat! It made it tough to stay in bed until the dorm lights came on at <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->->.
"Tony gets up at <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->->, as she always does. West sleeps on, groaning a little. Probably in his dreams he’s shouting; sounds in dreams are always louder."
"But when you shave 𝘣𝘦𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘦 breakfast like she has me do some mornings— <-<-<-<six-thirty in the morning>->->-> in a room all white walls and white basins, and long-tube-lights in the ceiling making sure there aren’t any shadows, and faces all round you trapped screaming behind the mirrors—then what chance you got against one of their machines?"
"At the beginning of each day the properly dated OD card is inserted in a slot in the steel door and the walls hum up: Lights flash on in the dorm at <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->->: the Acutes up out of bed quick as the black boys can prod them out, get them to work buffing the floor, emptying ash trays, polishing the scratch marks off the wall where one old fellow shorted out a day ago, went down in an awful twist of smoke and smell of burned rubber."
"Inside now, MJ ordered. She pushed the three of us into the hotel room, then shut the door. I glanced at the clock by the bed. <-<-<-<6.30 am.>->->-> Why were they waking Mum and Dad up this early?"
"Daniel and the FBI men listened to the sounds of his mother waking up his father. Daniel still held the door-knob. He was ready to close the door the second he was told to.<br>""What time is it?"" said his father in a drugged voice.<br>""Oh my God, it's <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->->,"" his mother said."
"It was <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->->. When the baby's cry came, they could not pick it out, and Sam, eagerly thrusting his face amongst their ears, said, ""Listen, there, there, that's the new baby."" He was red with delight and success."
It was very cold sitting in the truck and after a while he got out and walked around and flailed at himself with his arms and stamped his boots. Then he got back in the truck. The bar clock said <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->->...By eight-thirty he’d decided that it that was it would take to make the cab arrive then that’s what he would do and he started the engine.
Nervously she jumped up and listened; the house itself was as still as ever; the footsteps had retreated. Through her wide-open window the brilliant rays of the morning sun were flooding her room with light. She looked up at the clock; it was <-<-<-<half-past six>->->->—too early for any of the household to be already astir.
"Six-thirty was clearly a preposterous time and he, the client, obviously hadn't meant it seriously. A civilised <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->-> for twelve noon was almost certainly what he had in mind, and if he wanted to cut up rough about it, Dirk would have no option but to start handing out some serious statistics. Nobody got murdered before lunch. But nobody. People weren't up to it. You needed a good lunch to get both the blood-sugar and blood-lust levels up. Dirk had the figures to prove it."
"Sometimes they were hooded carts, sometimes they were just open carts, with planks for seats, on which sat twelve cloaked and bonneted women, six a side, squeezed together, for the interminable journey. As late as 1914 I knew the carrier of Croydon-cum-Clopton, twelve miles from Cambridge; his cart started at <-<-<-<6.30>->->-> in the morning and got back at about ten at night. Though he was not old, he could neither read nor write; but he took commissions all along the road - a packet of needles for Mrs. This, and a new teapot for Mrs. That - and delivered them all correctly on the way back."
"<-<-<-<6:31 A.M.>->->-><br>""Alpha Leader, this is SEAL One. I think we've spotted some hostiles."""
"<-<-<-<6:32 A.M.>->->-><br>Mark had awoken, but he wasn’t awake. His head was swimming with incoherent thoughts. The first vision to flash across his mind was Elizabeth; he smiled."
"He had been parked there for seven minutes already; he could only afford a few more before someone might become suspicious.<br>""C'mon. . . c'mon,"" he was muttering. ""Let's get this over with.""<br>He checked his watch: <-<-<-<6:32 a.m.>->->->"
"BURBANK AIRPORT<br><-<-<-<6:32 A.M.>->->-><br>Rush hour traffic crept forward in the pale morning light. Casey twisted her rearview mirror, and leaned over to check her makeup."
The familiar radium numerals on my left wrist confirmed the clock tower. It was <-<-<-<twenty-eight minutes to seven>->->->. I seemed to be filling a set of loud maroon pajamas which were certainly not mine. My vis-a-vis was wearing a little number in yellow.
"Woke <-<-<-<6.33 a.m.>->->-> Last session with Anderson. He made it plain he's seen enough of me, and from now on I'm better alone. To sleep 8:00? (These count-downs terrify me.) He paused, then added: Goodbye, Eniwetok."
"<-<-<-<6:34 A.M.>->->-><br>The leader of the SEALs, Lieutenant Devon Robbins, spoke into his thin microphone. ""Can you see them? We could use an IR scope."" The SEALs had split into two teams, as was their practice, and he was leading the first."
"Mark woke with a start and sat up, trying to focus his eyes on his watch. All he could see was the second hand moving: <-<-<-<6:35>->->->. Hell. He shot up from the chair, his stiff neck and back hurting him; he was still dressed."
"My watch lay on the dressing-table close by; glancing at it, I saw that the time was <-<-<-<twenty-five minutes to seven>->->->. I had been told that the family breakfasted at nine, so I had nearly two-and-a-half hours of leisure. Of course, I would go out, and enjoy the freshness of the morning."
"Kaldren pursues me like luminescent shadow. He has chalked up on the gateway '96,688,365,498,702'. Should confuse the mail man. Woke 9:05. To sleep <-<-<-<6:36>->->->."
<-<-<-<06:37 GMT>->->-><br>Jackie didn't need a wake-up call that morning. She was already on her way to Waterloo station by the time William was speeding down the M4.
"The dashboard clock said <-<-<-<6.37 am>->->->. Town frowned, and checked his wristwatch, which blinked that it was 1.58 pm. Great, he thought. I was either up on that tree for eight hours, or for minus a minute."
"The clock on the dashboard said it was <-<-<-<6.38 am>->->->. He left the keys in the car, and walked toward the tree."
"He fired another torpedo at <-<-<-<0639>->->-> hours from a distance of 500 metres. Again it missed its intended target, but exploded seven minutes later. The torpedos would only detonate on contact with a solid object."
"<-<-<-<6:39 A.M.>->->-><br>""Hold your fire! Goddammit, hold your fire."" The SEAL leader, Lieutenant Devon Robbins, was pressing in his earpiece, incredulous at what he was hearing."
"At eleven o'clock the phone rang, and still the figure did not respond, any more than it has responded when the phone had rung at twenty-five to seven in the morning, and again at <-<-<-<twenty to seven>->->->"
"A car drove past at a crawl, its driver eyeing her curiously through the slow-moving windscreen wipers, and she pretended to rummage for something in her pocket, trying to look like a normal person, on her way to a normal day. It was <-<-<-<nineteen minutes to seven>->->->."
It was <-<-<-<06:42>->->-> and he had just finished his solo morning workout: three circuits of Ring 7 - the second-longest ring in the hab-disk - followed by a half hour pushing and pulling against resistance channels in the gym.
Perhaps the insistent metallic sound was just part of his dream. He reluctantly turned over and blinked at the little phosphorescent green hands on the bedside clock: <-<-<-<6:43 a.m.>->->->
At <-<-<-<6:43>->->-> the driver pulled off the highway and followed the signs for La Guardia. No one spoke until the car came to a halt at the curb opposite the Marine Air terminal entrance.
"After throwing the lather on his face, he shaved too quickly, mowing down the stubble on his chin. Damn it, three nicks; the aftershave lotion stung viciously: <-<-<-<6:43>->->->."
"To London on the <-<-<-<6.43 am>->->->. Jessica is back from her holiday. Things are looking up, she called me Chris, instead of Minister, when we talked on the phone this afternoon."
Simon is happy to travel scum class when he's on his own and even sometimes deliberately aims for the 6.25. But today the .25 is delayed to <-<-<-<6.44>->->->.
"<-<-<-<Six-forty-five>->->-> the shavers buzz and the Acutes line up in alphabetical order at the mirrors, A, B, C, D. . . . The walking Chronics like me walk in when the Acutes are done, then the Wheelers are wheeled in."
"The black boy’s dwarf head swivels and comes nose to knuckle with that hand. He frowns at it, then takes a quick check where’s the other two black boys just in case, and tells McMurphy they don’t open the cabinet till <-<-<-<six-forty-five>->->->. “It’s a policy,” he says."
"As the clock pointed to a <-<-<-<quarter to seven>->->->, the dog woke and shook himself. After waiting in vain for the footman, who was accustomed to let him out, the animal wandered restlessly from one closed door to another on the ground floor; and, returning to his mat in great perplexity, appealed to the sleeping family, with a long and melancholy howl."
"He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck <-<-<-<quarter to seven>->->->. There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. ""Gregor"", somebody called - it was his mother - ""it's quarter to seven. Didn't you want to go somewhere?"""
"He bundled the papers on his desk into his briefcase and ran for the elevator. First piece of luck, it was on the top floor. Downstairs: <-<-<-<6:46>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<one minute after the quarter to seven>->->-> I heard the rattle of the cans outside. I opened the front door, and there was my man, singling out my cans from a bunch he carried and whistling through his teeth."
"“Morning, Mark. Hell, man, is it eight o’clock already?”<br>“No, <-<-<-<thirteen minutes to seven>->->->.”"
Car starts first time. Reliable Mercedes. Moves on the road: <-<-<-<6:48>->->->. Must stay below speed limit. Never embarrass the Bureau.
"Big Al stretched and began to walk slowly around the car. He knew they planned to leave long before first light, which was at <-<-<-<6:48 A.M.>->->-> He checked his watch: 4:17. They both looked up when a plane flew overhead, the first to land at Heathrow that morning."
"His jet had touched down on the facility's runway at <-<-<-<6:48 A.M.>->->-> and been promptly towed into the hangar. Tanzan Mino intended to be in personal command when Daedalus I went hypersonic, in just nineteen hours."
"Night ends, <-<-<-<6:49>->->->. Meet in the coffee shop at 7:30; press conference at 10:00."
"That night I lay in my jangling single bed across from Sammy’s and I watched him sleep, and then I stared at the ceiling. I got up and took a blanket and went and made a cup of tea, and lay on the sofa and tried to read one of the wrinkled paperbacks. I blinked my way through a hallucinatory half chapter, set it aside and closed my eyes. I woke and it was <-<-<-<six fifty>->->->, and I winced my way upstairs and lay down in my bed, to be there when Sammy woke up again."
"Will, my fiancé, was coming from Boston on the <-<-<-<six-fifty>->->-> train - the dawn train, the only train that still stopped in the small Ohio city where I lived."
"Moon Hartnell opened her eyes and reached for her phone. The screen said <-<-<-<6.51 a.m.>->->-> on 14 February, Valentine's Day. Most mornings, she would stay in bed until her alarm went off. Usually for a while after that, too - as long as it took Mum to bang on her door."
"Sasha and Charlie caught the <-<-<-<6:52>->->-> from Victoria to Merrifield the following morning, and arrived at the local Labour Party headquarters just before 8 a.m."
"Having lied to Mum, I realised that my only option was to take the <-<-<-<06.52>->->-> to London as if I hadn't been dismissed at all."
"So that was the key to asking my questions, to wait exactly 77 minutes before <-<-<-<seven minutes to seven>->->-> and I would then get my answer."
"And to see if maybe - just maybe - she might have answered him, even though it was now <-<-<-<six minutes before seven in the morning>->->->."
"It was <-<-<-<five minutes to seven>->->-> the next morning. Sergeant Masterson and Detective Constable Greeson were in the kitchen at Nightingale House with Miss Collins and Mr. Muncie. It seemed like the middle of the night to Masterson, dark and cold."
At <-<-<-<6:55 am>->->-> Lisa parked and took the lift from the frozen underground car park up to level 1 of Green Oaks Shopping Centre.
"Well, I've only to say I'm sorry to cause all this fuss, y'know - and, well, yes, I would like a smoke, replied the condemned man, and added hastily: ""Don't think I want to delay things for a moment though - but if there is time. . .""<br>""It is <-<-<-<four minutes to seven>->->->,"" said Major Ranald, ""and tobacco and matches are not supposed to be found in a government jail."""
"Down ramp, park, show FBI pass to garage guard, run for elevator: <-<-<-<6:57>->->->;"
That meant that Helen must run and get the table set as quickly as possible as it was <-<-<-<three minutes to seven>->->->.
"They waited. At exactly <-<-<-<two minutes to seven>->->->, a white car came into view and pulled into the employee's parking lot behind the building."
"<-<-<-<6:58 A.M.>->->-><br>Hugo Voorst was lying propped against a rock, his shoulder bandaged with white strips of gauze from the first-aid kit. Now that the flow of blood had been staunched, Marcel was injecting him with a shot of morphine to quell the looming pain."
She barely glances up; knock on door of Director’s office; no reply; go in as instructed. No Director: <-<-<-<6:59>->->->; sink into easy chair. Director going to be late; smile of satisfaction.
"At <-<-<-<one minute to seven>->->->, Lieutenant Colonel Robertson marched up on to the stage, and everyone else in the room quickly fell silent and sprang to attention. He stopped in the center of the stage and waved the men down."
"It was <-<-<-<6.59 a.m.>->->-> on Maundy Thursday as Blomkvist and Berger let themselves into the ""Millennium"" offices."
Moist groaned. It was the crack of <-<-<-<seven>->->-> and he was allergic to the concept of two seven o’clocks in one day.
"By the time the sun peered over the hills east of Rome, the city was a raucous symphony of clattering carts, hammer blows, and screaming babies. Some in the leisure class allowed themselves the luxury of slumbering on till <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->, but only those who had wined to excess would rise any later."
"And we on for a video chat tonight? I mean, in the morning? Your morning? Charlie asked.<br>""Yeah, do you have a time in mind so I can be sure to be up and showered first?""<br>""Sure you can't video chat from the shower?"" he asked.<br>""Not so much. No.""<br>""Then I guess I'll settle for <-<-<-<seven>->->->."""
"It was about <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> and so still I felt that, if someone had spoken a mile away, I could have answered him."
"At <-<-<-<seven>->->-> the next morning the telephone rang.<br>Slowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep. I already had a telegram from Jay Cee stuck in my mirror, telling me not to bother to come in to work but to rest for a day and get completely well, and how sorry she was about the bad crabmeat, so I couldn’t imagine who would be calling."
"Anne made her way across the dooryard, trailing a steadying hand along the side of Bobbi’s truck. When she had passed the truck, she reached at once for the porch railing. She looked up, and in the slanting light of <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->, Gardener thought the woman looked both aged and ageless."
"Grant immediately understood the advantages. It was now <-<-<-<seven o’clock in the morning>->->->. They had at least eight miles to go. If they could take a raft along the river, they would make much faster progress than going overland."
"Through September and right into October, the North Carolina skies were clear and the air was warm even at <-<-<-<seven in the morning>->->->, when I left my second-floor apartment by the outside stairs. If I started with a light jacket on, I was wearing it tied around my waist before I’d finished half of the three miles between the town and the amusement park."
"The call was early: <-<-<-<seven AM>->->->, two hours before the park opened its doors on another summer. The three of us walked down the beach together. Tom talked most of the way. He always talked. It would have been wearisome if he hadn’t been so amusing and relentlessly cheerful."
"Thirty-seven times my mother and I woke up together, bleary and exhausted at <-<-<-<seven A.M.>->->->, tried to get up, but fell back into bed and slept on while cartoons flashed from the small television on her bedside table."
"In his hotel room at the Bon Voyage, Dr. Rufus Sixsmith reads a sheaf of letters written to him nearly half a century ago by his friend Robert Frobisher. Sixsmith knows them by heart, but their texture, rustle, and his friend’s faded handwriting calm his nerves. These letters are what he would save from a burning building. At <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> precisely, he washes, changes his shirt, and sandwiches the nine read letters in the Gideon’s Bible—this he replaces in the bedside cabinet. Sixsmith slips the unread letters into his jacket pocket for the restaurant."
"This morning everything is clean; the storm has left branches strewn around the yard, which I will presently go out and pick up: all the beach’s sand has been redistributed and laid down fresh in an even blanket pocked with impressions of rain, and the daylilies bend and glisten in the white <-<-<-<seven a.m.>->->-> light."
"By <-<-<-<7:00 A.M.>->->->, the coastline of Malibu was engulfed in flames. Because, just as it is in Malibu’s nature to burn, so was it in one particular person’s nature to set fire and walk away."
"“Which means we finish around <-<-<-<7 a.m.>->->->,” she added. “Still enough time to get to work.”<br>I was surprised. “Work?”<br>“You must work tomorrow, yes?”<br>“I figured I’d write the day off.”<br>“Then you do not need to worry.”"
"<-<-<-<Seven o’clock>->->-> the mess hall opens and the order of line-up reverses: the Wheelers first, then the Walkers, then Acutes pick up trays, corn flakes, bacon and eggs, toast—and this morning a canned peach on a piece of green, torn lettuce."
"“What? No. I mean, yeah, that’s when we have to be in the lot, but there’s a bunch of stuff before, you know, costumes, makeup, all that. I usually get there at <-<-<-<seven>->->->. I can’t believe nobody told you any of this.”"
"It was <-<-<-<seven a.m.>->->-> on the day before her eleventh birthday, and Eva was on her knees in her favorite stretchy blue jeans, hard at work in her closet. She was checking the dryness of her hydroponic chile plants when her mom knocked on her door."
"Why was this woman here? They would have a glass of wine and then Cindy would say that she had a <-<-<-<7:00 a.m.>->->-> yoga class (which was true) and boy, was she tired."
"At <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> precisely, a tiny Italian man entered James’s office. He was wearing a very ancient tuxedo and a white bow tie, which was almost exactly the same size and shape as the mustache on his upper lip."
"Seven o'clock, already, he said to himself when the clock struck again, ""<-<-<-<seven o'clock>->->->, and there's still a fog like this."""
"At <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> in the morning, Rubashov was awakened by a bugle, but he did not get up. Soon he heard sounds in the corridor. He imagined that someone was to be tortured, and he dreaded hearing the first screams of pain. When the footsteps reached his own section, he saw through the eye hole that guards were serving breakfast. Rubashov did not receive any breakfast because he had reported himself ill. He began to pace up and down the cell, six and a half steps to the window, six and a half steps back."
"I had left directions that I was to be called at <-<-<-<seven>->->->; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments, only, could be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed."
"She locked herself in, made no reply to my bonjour through the door; she was up at <-<-<-<seven o'clock>->->->, the samovar was taken in to her from the kitchen."
"I took the first tentative step towards finding out at <-<-<-<one minute past seven>->->-> the next morning, in Fort Bird's mortuary."
"<-<-<-<07:02>->->->:18 One and a half hours. ""Case,"" she said, ""I wanna favour."""
<-<-<-<7:03 a.m.>->->-> Return to bed in sulk over weight. Head-state bad. Sleeping or getting up equally out of question. Think about Daniel.
There was trouble with the track. No one could give any idea when it would be put right. The train arriving at <-<-<-<three minutes past seven>->->-> had been the last one in. Were all the gods of travel conspiring to thwart him?
And hitherto it had decreed that someone should begin to wash and tidy me up at exactly <-<-<-<three minutes after 7 am>->->->.
<-<-<-<7:03 am>->->-> General Tanz woke up as though aroused by a mental alarm-clock.
<-<-<-<7:04 A.M.>->->-><br>Stone felt his consciousness returning as the blast of an engine cut through his sedative‑induced reverie. Where was he? There were vibrations all around him and a deafening roar that was slowly spiraling upward in frequency and volume.
"He really couldn't believe that the old woman who'd phoned him last night would show up this morning, as she'd said she would. He decided he'd wait until <-<-<-<five minutes after seven o'clock>->->->, and then he'd call in, take the day off, and make every effort in the book to locate someone reliable."
"Outside my window the sky hung low and gray. It looked like snow, which added to my malaise. The clock read <-<-<-<five after seven>->->->. I punched the remote control and watched the morning news as I lay in bed."
"Ryan missed the dawn. He boarded a TWA 747 that left Dulles on time, at <-<-<-<7:05 A.M.>->->-> The sky was overcast, and when the aircraft burst through the cloud layer into sunlight, Ryan did something he had never done before. For the first time in his life, Jack Ryan fell asleep on an airplane."
"Percy subscribed to that old axiom about how you should get right back on the horse that had thrown you, because here he came through the door at <-<-<-<six minutes past seven>->->->, resplendent in his blue uniform with his sidearm on one hip and his hickory stick in its ridiculous custom-made holster on the other."
"Qantas Flight 102 touched down at Melbourne Airport at <-<-<-<seven minutes past seven>->->->. Charlie was the first off the aircraft, running as fast as he could, but having to lug Cathy’s picture under one arm slowed him down and made it possible for several other passengers, who obviously had the same idea, to overtake him."
"When Joubert walked into the parade room at <-<-<-<seven minutes past seven>->->-> on the first of January, forty detectives were already seated on the blue-gray government-issue chairs placed in a large rectangle against the four walls."
"<-<-<-<7:08 A.M.>->->-><br>""Team Two CQ,"" came Hans' voice on the walkie-talkie. He and Marcel were in the overhead ventilation duct above Command, which had been depicted in great detail in the blueprints."
Reacher had no watch but he figured when he saw Gregory it must have been <-<-<-<between eight and nine minutes after seven o'clock>->->->.
"We wake up and the air is shiverier. Watch says <-<-<-<07:09>->->->, he has a battery, that’s his own little power hidden inside."
"The morning house lay empty. The clock ticked on, repeating and repeating its sounds into the emptiness. Seven-nine, breakfast time, <-<-<-<seven-nine>->->->!"
"“Get me the head of the Secret Service at the White House.”<br>“Yes, sir.”<br>The Director glanced at his watch: <-<-<-<7:10>->->->. Andrews was due at 8:15. The phone rang."
"When he woke, he jumped out of bed and pulled back the curtains to see the first rays of sunlight bathing the city. He checked the time. It was <-<-<-<7:10 a.m.>->->-> He felt grubby, and smiled at the thought of a long, hot bath."
"A search in Bradshaw informed me that a train left St. Pancras at <-<-<-<7.10>->->->, which would land me at any Galloway station in the late afternoon."
"There were many others waiting to execute the same operation, so she would have to move fast, elbow her way to the front so that she emerged first. The time was <-<-<-<7:10>->->-> in the morning. The manoeuvre would start at 7:12. She looked apprehensively at the giant clock at the railway station."
"Anyway, every morning at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past seven>->->-> he'd slam the door and rev the engine like he was starting a grand prix, ruining my beauty sleep, especially if I'd just come off nights."
"<-<-<-<7:11 a.m.>->->-><br>It could have been the sound of a single explosion, even though it had taken place at the two opposite entries to Command. Then, as one, Team One and Team Three were inside, just behind the harmless explosions of flash grenades and charges of CS they had blasted into the room."
"At <-<-<-<twelve minutes past seven>->->->, in the kitchen, Kimberly was becoming anxious. She had been told by Sister Holland that Miss Gradwyn had asked for her early-morning tea tray to be brought up at seven o'clock."
"He taught me that if I had to meet someone for an appointment, I must refuse to follow the ""stupid human habit"" of arbitrarily choosing a time based on fifteen-minute intervals. ""Never meet people at 7:45 or 6:30, Jasper, but pick times like <-<-<-<7:12>->->-> and 8:03!"""
"It was all the more surprising and indeed alarming a little later, said Austerlitz, when I looked out of the corridor window of my carriage just before the train left at <-<-<-<seven-thirteen>->->->, to find it dawning upon me with perfect certainty that I had seen the pattern of glass and steel roof above the platforms before."
"<-<-<-<07:14>->->-> GMT<br>William spotted him the moment he entered the terminal. A dark blue double-breasted blazer, white shirt, and striped tie. The commander probably slept in double-breasted pajamas."
"I jump onto Rocker to look at Watch, he says <-<-<-<07:14>->->->. I can skateboard on Rocker without holding on to her, then I whee back onto Duvet and I’m snowboarding instead."
At <-<-<-<7.14>->->-> Harry knew he was alive. He knew that because the pain could be felt in every nerve fibre.
"The raft drifted steadily north. “There must be a current.” The current was carrying them north, toward the hotel. He looked at his watch and was astonished to see it was <-<-<-<fifteen minutes past seven>->->->. Only fifteen minutes had passed since he had last looked at his watch. It seemed like two hours."
"At <-<-<-<7:15 A.M.>->->->, January 25th, we started flying northwestward under McTighe's pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food supply, and other items including the plane's wireless outfit."
"Gough again knocked on Mr. and Mrs. Kent's bedroom door. This time it was opened - Mary Kent had got out of bed and put on her dressing gown, having just checked her husband's watch: it was <-<-<-<7.15>->->->. A confused conversation ensued, in which each woman seemed to assume Saville was with the other."
"It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a <-<-<-<quarter-past seven>->->->, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits."
"The Zombie SmartGuide works much harder to construct these fictional, time-travel tooth-brushing scenarios than it ever did on normal tooth-brushing scenarios when it was alive. It literally does this all day long. Lately it's taken to showing the transition from <-<-<-<07.16>->->-> to 07.17 quite frequently."
"As of <-<-<-<7.17 am>->->-> local time on 30 June 1908, Padzhitnoff had been working for nearly a year as a contract employee of the Okhrana, receiving five hundred rubles a month, a sum which hovered at the exorbitant end of spy-budget outlays for those years."
"<-<-<-<7:18 A.M.>->->-><br>""Ulysses to Sirene. Do you read me?""<br>When his radio crackled, Armont was in the medical facility of the Bates Motel, watching as a plasma IV was attached to Dimitri's arm. He immediately grabbed for it."
"I opened the sunroof and turned up the CD player volume to combat fatigue, and at <-<-<-<7.19 am>->->-> on Saturday, with the caffeine still running all around my brain, Jackson Browne and I pulled into Moree."
"The two policemen arrived at the Hotel Monarche at <-<-<-<twenty past seven>->->-> that Thursday morning. They were tired, discontent, and hungry. Since midnight they had visited forty-three hotels on the west side of the city, on each occasion with no success."
"The Chairman got out of bed at <-<-<-<7:20>->->-> and lit his first cigarette. He couldn’t remember exactly when he had woken. At 6:10 he had phoned Tony, who was already up and waiting for his call."
"At <-<-<-<7:20>->->->, the door swung open and Anne reappeared to carry out her most important function of the day. “Time to take you through to the studio, Harry.”"
And this was my timetable when I lived at home with Father and I thought that Mother was dead from a heart attack (this was the timetable for a Monday and also it is an approximation). <-<-<-<7.20 a.m.>->->-> Wake up
"He who had been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the possible and improbable adventures of each new day. He escaped from reality till the alarm-clock rang, at <-<-<-<seven-twenty>->->->."
"Why it felt important to know the time she didn’t know, other than to try and root herself in the midst of this chaos. <-<-<-<7.21 a.m.>->->-> So many people would have been eating breakfast, getting ready for work or the Passover holiday."
"<-<-<-<7:22 A.M.>->->-><br>""Do you know how to handle this?"" Vance handed Cally the MP5 he was carrying. He had brought it up the hill to try to take out Ramirez, but after the fiasco with the flash grenades, he hadn't fired a shot."
"<-<-<-<7:23 A.M.>->->-><br>The transmit seemed to be working, and he was getting out everything he knew—the location of the Hind, the fake nationality, the attack on the frigate. But was anybody picking it up? The heavy Soviet radio was rapidly drawing down its batteries, but he figured it was now or never."
Sebastian had to borrow his mother’s alarm clock to make sure he was up in time to catch the <-<-<-<7:23>->->-> to Paddington. Emma was waiting for him in the hall and offered to drive him to Temple Meads. It soon became clear why.
"All three morning shows had offered him their highest rated spot, at <-<-<-<7:24 a.m.>->->-> Six minutes didn’t sound like a long time, but in television terms, only ex-presidents and Oscar winners could take it for granted."
"There was a brief murmur of voices; then Stephen Courtney-Brigs followed her into the sitting-room. Glancing at the clock, Dalgliesh saw that the hands stood at <-<-<-<7:24 a.m.>->->-> The working day had almost begun."
"After taking several phone calls during breakfast, she still hadn’t had a chance to consider the arguments for and against Lord Samuels’s proposal before her driver pulled up outside the front door at <-<-<-<7:25 a.m.>->->->"
"At <-<-<-<twenty-five minutes past seven>->->->: Ker Karraje, Engineer Serko and Captain Spade advance to the extermity of the point, where they sweep the north-western horizon with their telescopes."
"He tried one more time at <-<-<-<7:25>->->->, and nothing had changed. It ran and ran, eleven, twelve, thirteen times.<br>He threw his guitar in his dad’s car and drove south toward Prescott. The Built to Spill tape was still in the tape deck, and he just let it keep going; it might as well be the damn soundtrack to everything."
<-<-<-<7.25 a.m.>->->-> Clean teeth and wash face
Chuck was on deck at <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes past seven>->->-> when marines in helmets and backpacks began to swarm down the rope nets hanging over the sides of the ship and jump into the high-sided landing craft.
The pilot welcomed them aboard and warned them there might be a slight delay. Dexter checked his watch: <-<-<-<7:27>->->->. He began drumming his fingers on the armrest that divided him from Scott.
His appointment with the doctor was for 8.45. It was <-<-<-<7.27>->->->.
"As you know, we're on twenty-four hour call and I got here at <-<-<-<seven twenty-eight>->->->. We decided to start the investigation at once. The undertakers will collect the body as soon as you've finished."
"Lamont was waiting for her on platform 11, and they boarded the <-<-<-<7:29>->->-> to Guildford, second class. On arrival they were met by Superintendent Wall, the only man from the Surrey Constabulary who'd been fully briefed on what they had planned for the rest of the day."
"Everybody turns in his chair and watches that butter sneak on down the wall, starting, hanging still, shooting ahead and leaving a shiny trail behind it on the pane. Nobody says a word. They look at the butter, then at the clock, then back at the butter. The clock’s moving now.<br>The butter makes it down to the floor about a half <-<-<-<minute before seven-thirty>->->->, and McMurphy gets back all the money he lost."
"At <-<-<-<7.29>->->-> in the morning of 1 July, the cinematographer finds himself filming silence itself."
"About <-<-<-<half-past seven>->->-> I woke, and opened my window on a fine sunshiny day. The clock had struck eight, and I was just going out to chain up the dogs again, when I heard a sudden whisking of petticoats on the stairs behind me."
"At <-<-<-<seven-thirty>->->->, Chetta Reynolds blew into the examining room where the Stones and their ceaselessly screaming baby daughter had been stashed. The poet rumored to be on the short list for Presidential Medal of Freedom was dressed in straight-leg jeans and a BU sweatshirt with a hole in one elbow."
"At <-<-<-<seven-thirty>->->-> the next morning, after less than three hours of broken, nightmare-haunted sleep, Tess booted up her office computer. But not to write. Writing was the farther thing from her mind."
"<-<-<-<Seven-thirty>->->-> back to the day room. The Big Nurse looks out through her special glass, always polished till you can’t tell it’s there, and nods at what she sees, reaches up and tears a sheet off her calendar one day closer to the goal."
At <-<-<-<half-past seven>->->-> the next morning he rang the bell of 21 Blenheim Avenue.
"Precisely at <-<-<-<half past seven>->->-> the station-master came into the traffic office. He weighed almost sixteen stone, but women always said that he was incredibly light on his feet when he danced."
I told him he'd sold me on that and we folded the maps and put them back into their waterproof pouches. This was at <-<-<-<07:31>->->-> and Ferris got up and stretched his legs and asked for flying instructions.
"<-<-<-<7:31 A.M.>->->-><br>Bill Bates looked through the Sikorsky's wide windscreen and saw them coming. The time had arrived, he realized immediately, to make a move. Now or never."
"At <-<-<-<7:32>->->->, he suffered a fatal stroke."
"He was taken from me, by the inscrutable decree of the Almighty, on the fifth of this month at <-<-<-<thirty-three minutes past seven>->->-> in the morning, and died in peace of an influential attack of the chest - he had been asthmatic of late years, though otherwise in good health, praise God."
"Wednesday <-<-<-<7:33 A.M.>->->-><br>""You're lucky I love this spot,"" Vance said, gazing out over the city. ""Nothing else on the planet could have got me up this early in the morning."""
"<-<-<-<7:34>->->->. Monday morning, Blackeberg. The burglar alarm at the ICA grocery store on Arvid Morne's way is set off."
"He made another entry in his logbook when Summers emerged from the building at <-<-<-<7:34>->->->, and set off in the direction of the local nick as his radio sprang to life. He listened carefully to what Paul had to report, and said he’d deal with it as soon as he was back in the office."
"Florentyna Kane did not wake until <-<-<-<7:35>->->->. She rolled over, trying to recall the dream she had just had, but none of it would come back to her, so she let her mind wander."
"Trying to identify the key facts, Ethan was suddenly aware he was looking at the wall clock; it was <-<-<-<7:35>->->->.<br>“Wait a minute. When did you hear about this?”<br>There was a tiny moment of hesitation. “The first news came in just before five.”"
"I told him that it was me and he said, ""It’s <-<-<-<7.35>->->-> on a Sunday morning. This is terribly inconsiderate of you. I realize you’re besotted with Marigold, but you must try and restrain your passion. Come to lunch. I’ve got something to show you."""
At <-<-<-<7:35 am>->->-> Ishigami left his apartment as he did every weekday morning.
I looked at my watch. <-<-<-<Seven thirty-five>->->->.
"<-<-<-<7:36>->->->, sunrise. The hospital blinds were much better, darker than her own."
"My telephone rang at <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes to eight>->->->, just as I put a cup of coffee down on the breakfast table."
"<-<-<-<7:38 A.M.>->->-><br>""I copy,"" Nichols said into his mike. ""When did the chopper lift off?"""
"At <-<-<-<7:39>->->-> the aircraft taxied onto the runway to prepare for takeoff. When it stopped, Dexter asked the flight attendant what was holding them up."
"Now, at the station, do you recall speaking to Mr. Joseph Markew?<br>""Yes, indeed. I was standing on the platform waiting for my usual train - the <-<-<-<7.39>->->-> - when he accosted me."""
<-<-<-<7.40 a.m.>->->-> Have breakfast.
He rushed downstairs. The hall was empty; <-<-<-<nineteen minutes to eight>->->->! The train left at eight o'clock. Had he time to saddle Bolero?
"So he really had no choice but to pay an occasional visit to the living room instead, where the hands on the grandfather clock now indicated, rather unambiguously, that it was <-<-<-<7:42>->->->."
"I had been in the tech ninja sleeve only a few hours— <-<-<-<seven, and forty-two minutes>->->-> according to the time display chipped into my upper-left field of vision—but there were none of the usual download side effects."
"<-<-<-<Seven forty-two>->->-> a.m., Mr. Gasparian: I curse you. I curse your arms so they will wither and die and fall off your body."
"It was <-<-<-<seventeen minutes to eight>->->->. It seemed to me that should give me plenty of leeway, but I hadn't been there five minutes before I started to worry that I'd missed him."
"‘If you’re referring to Sergeant Jennings, sir, when I arrived this morning at <-<-<-<sixteen minutes to eight>->->->, he was unshaven and incorrectly dressed, despite still being on duty. I didn’t bawl him out. But I did leave him in no doubt how I felt about his attitude and appearance while serving as a police officer.’"
"She voices her thoughts: ""It's not exactly how you'd choose to go, is it? You'd rather die flying a kite with your grandchildren, or at a great party or something. Not on the <-<-<-<seven forty-four>->->->."""
"As for Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a <-<-<-<quarter to eight>->->->. Now just consider…”"
"This morning I took the launch out for forty minutes or so to test the engine. She's been giving a bit of trouble. That took from <-<-<-<seven-forty-five>->->-> until twenty past eight, near enough."
"Tony marks papers until <-<-<-<quarter to eight>->->->. Sunlight floods the room, made golden by the yellow leaves outside; a jet flies over; the garbage truck approaches along the street, clanking like a tank."
"<-<-<-<Seven-forty-five>->->-> the black boys move down the line of Chronics taping catheters on the ones that will hold still for it. Catheters are second-hand condoms the ends clipped off and rubber-banded to tubes that run down pantlegs to a plastic sack marked DISPOSABLE NOT TO BE RE-USED, which it is my job to wash out at the end of each day."
"Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the Bergs’ house, not at ten but at <-<-<-<fifteen minutes to eight>->->->."
"Mr. Green left for work at a <-<-<-<quarter to eight>->->->, as he did every morning. He walked down his front steps carrying his empty-looking leatherette briefcase with the noisy silver clasps, opened his car door, and ducked his head to climb into the driver's seat."
"He taught me that if I had to meet someone for an appointment, I must refuse to follow the ""stupid human habit"" of arbitrarily choosing a time based on fifteen-minute intervals. ""Never meet people at <-<-<-<7:45>->->-> or 6:30, Jasper, but pick times like 7:12 and 8:03!"""
"He awoke with a start. The clock on his bedside table said <-<-<-<7.46 a.m.>->->-> He cursed, jumped out of bed and dressed. He stuffed his toothbrush and toothpaste in his jacket pocket, and parked outside the station just before 8 a.m. In reception, Ebba beckoned to him."
"He looked across at his son. ‘You been booking in all those names, the way I taught you?’<br>‘Sure have, Dad. Mr Parnell, <-<-<-<7.47>->->->; Mr Parker, 8.09; Mr Tudor-Jones, 8.11; Mr Alexander, 8.23.’"
"<-<-<-<7:47 A.M.>->->-><br>Vance had never been more scared in his life. This made a day at a stormy helm seem like a Sunday stroll. The down-draft was spinning him violently now, a lesson that rappelling was not for the faint of heart."
"<-<-<-<7:48 A.M.>->->-><br>Vance stared up the mountain, puzzled. The silence baffled him, and then he realized why. He was not hearing the usual high-tension hum of transformers; nothing was operating. They had shut down the power."
"<-<-<-<Eleven minutes to eight>->->->.<br>""You're always right; there must be a clock in your head."""
"When did you next see Dr. Wellesley?<br>""At just <-<-<-<eleven minutes to eight>->->->.""<br>""Where?""<br>""In the surgery.""<br>""He came back there?""<br>""Yes.""<br>""How do you fix that precise time--eleven minutes to eight?""<br>""Because he'd arranged to see a patient in Meadow Gate at ten minutes to eight. I glanced at the clock as he came in, saw what time it was, and reminded him of the appointment."""
"DI Hogan rang the front doorbell at <-<-<-<ten minutes to eight>->->->. It was opened a few moments later by someone who was clean-shaven, smartly dressed and clearly expecting him."
She and Dakers had said nothing of interest to each other while they had been working and had left the library at the same time and gone into breakfast together. That had been at about <-<-<-<ten minutes to eight>->->->.
"At about <-<-<-<ten minutes to eight>->->->, Jim had squared the part of the work he had been doing - the window - so he decided not to start on the door or the skirting until after breakfast."
"The plane swung around onto the take-off runway at <-<-<-<7:51>->->->, its jets revving before it moved slowly forward, then gathered speed. The wheels left the ground at 7:53."
"Vimes fished out the Gooseberry as a red-hot cabbage smacked into the road behind him. ""Good morning!"" he said brightly to the surprised imp. ""What is the time, please?""<br>""Er...<-<-<-<nine minutes to eight>->->->, Insert Name Here,"" said the imp."
Homicide Detective David Neiser arrived at the house on Twin Peaks Drive at <-<-<-<eight minutes to eight>->->->. Chief Criminal Deputy Joe Doench was already there.
"The plane swung around onto the take-off runway at 7:51, its jets revving before it moved slowly forward, then gathered speed. The wheels left the ground at <-<-<-<7:53>->->->."
"What time is it?<br>""<-<-<-<Seven to eight>->->->. Won't be long now."""
"When I awoke on the arrival of the others, it was <-<-<-<six minutes to eight in the morning>->->-> of the same day, today. Not two hours had passed from my rising, and time was back to normal. But the things that happened in that time could never be compressed into two hours."
"Maybe now isn't the best time for you to see her, Mr. Dresden.<br>I glanced up at the clock on the wall. It was <-<-<-<five minutes before eight>->->->. ""She wanted me early."" I stepped to one side to go around him."
"Over breakfast, they discussed anything but work, a golden rule, before heading off together for the commander’s morning briefing. They were all seated around the boss’s table by <-<-<-<7:55>->->->, waiting for the Hawk to open proceedings."
"At <-<-<-<five minutes to eight>->->->, the Prime Minister emerged from Wilson’s office, followed by Halifax and Cadogan. Wilson was the last to appear. He looked irritated. Legat guessed he must have had a further argument with Cadogan."
at <-<-<-<7.55>->->-> this morning the circus ran away to join me.
"Sebastian was putting on his jacket and heading for the door when the phone rang for a third time. He looked at his watch, <-<-<-<7:56>->->->, and thought about ignoring it, but turned back, grabbed the phone, and said, “I haven’t got time, Mother.”"
"At <-<-<-<7:56>->->->, Anna closed the Wentworth file and bent down to opent the bottom drawer of her desk. She slipped off her sneakers and replaced them with a pair of high-heeled shoes. She rose from her chair, gathered up the files, and glanced in the mirror - not a hair out of place."
"Bursting in unannounced <-<-<-<just before 8:00 a.m.>->->->, Eric Snow slapped the Examiner onto his associate pastor's desk. Art ignored the paper and instead made eye contact with his boss, offering him a transparently insincere grin."
"I sit by the window, crunching toast, sipping coffee, and leafing through the paper in a leisurely way. At last, after devouring three slices, two cups of coffee, and all the Saturday sections, I stretch my arms in a big yawn and glance at the clock. I don't believe it. It's only <-<-<-<seven fifty-six>->->->."
The Castle Gate - only the Castle Gate - and it was <-<-<-<four minutes to eight>->->->.
"Emma read the detailed submissions from both presidents during her journey across London, but hadn’t come down in favor of either side by the time her car pulled into Harley Street. She placed the file back in the red box and checked her watch: <-<-<-<7:57>->->->."
"<-<-<-<7:57 A.M.>->->-><br>As Alexa stepped out of the lobby, the morning was glorious and clear. Spring had arrived in a burst of pear and cherry blossoms in the garden of St. Luke's Church, up the street, but here by the river the morning air was still brisk enough to make her skin tingle."
"He had to catch the conspirators alive, get them to testify against the Senator. The Director checked his watch with the clock on the Old Post Office Tower over the Washington Field Office. It was <-<-<-<7:58>->->->."
"McEnany looked at the clock in the corner of the video screen. It said <-<-<-<7:58 AM>->->->. A few more keystrokes, and Paige Caldwell's voice came through his headset."
At <-<-<-<one minute to eight>->->-> he set off at a brisk pace down the path that would take them to the base of the mountain.
"It was right at <-<-<-<eight o'clock, maybe a minute before>->->->. I went into the demo room to see if I'd left my tin of polish there. And there was this bottle of milk on the trolley and I drank some of it. Just a bit off the top."
"I'd spent fifty two days in 1958, but here it was <-<-<-<7.59>->->-> in the morning."
"Philip Lombard had the habit of waking at daybreak. He did so on this particular morning. He raised himself on an elbow and listened. The wind had somewhat abated but was still blowing. He could hear no sound of rain…<br>At <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> the wind was blowing more strongly, but Lombard did not hear it. He was asleep again."
"The boys' loud laughter turned into groans, however, when he coldly informed them they would have school all afternoon that day instead of the usual <-<-<-<8:00>->->-> to 11:30."
"School had started at <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->-> and Gunther was late. Mr. Kunze, the teacher, greeted him briefly with ""Aha, a new bird!"" and motioned the brother to wheel his chair over by the window nearest to him."
"His landlady’s cook, who always brought him his breakfast at <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->, failed to appear on this occasion. That had never happened before."
"Tom Tooney devours his fettucini alfredo with a napkin tucked into the collar of his shirt, eating and slurping with abandon, and follows it up with a mixed-nut panna cotta. Holly has an antipasto and refuses dessert, settling for a cup of decaf (she eschews caffeine after <-<-<-<8 A.M.>->->->)."
"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at <-<-<-<eight o’clock in the morning>->->->, and was as follows:"
"The jungle river became narrower. The banks closed in on both sides until the trees and foliage overhanging the banks met high above to block out the sun. Tim heard the cry of birds, and saw small chirping dinosaurs leaping among the branches. But mostly it was silent, the air hot and still beneath the canopy of trees.<br>Grant looked at his watch. It was <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->."
"He sat in front of the consoles and gulped another cup of coffee. All around him, the control room was strewn with paper plates and half-eaten sandwiches. Arnold was exhausted. It was <-<-<-<8:00 A.M.>->->-> on Saturday."
"“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes, speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him too hard.”<br>“It is <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> now,” I said, glancing at my watch."
"The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.<br>“At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?” I asked.<br>“At <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->,” she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation."
"When the owner’s meal was ready at <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->, she pushed the room service cart into the elevator and rode up to the sixth floor. It was the standard meal for him: a half bottle of red wine with the cork loosened, a thermal pot of coffee, a chicken entrée with steamed vegetables, rolls and butter. The heavy aroma of cooked chicken quickly filled the little elevator. It mingled with the smell of rain."
"Going down the Rue des Dames I bump into Peckover, another poor devil who works on the paper. He complains of getting only three or four hours’ sleep a night—has to get up at <-<-<-<eight in the morning>->->-> to work at a dentist’s office. It isn’t for the money he’s doing it, so he explains—it’s for to buy himself a set of false teeth."
"I felt my head get heavy. Harrison Ford was my dream man. My heart slowed, but still, I couldn’t sleep. I drank from the jug of gin. It seemed to settle my stomach.<br>At <-<-<-<eight A.M.>->->->, I called Trevor again. This time he didn’t answer.<br>“Just checking in,” I said in my message. “It’s been a while. Curious how you’ve been and what you’ve been up to. Let’s catch up soon.”"
"The creature stuck her booty into a little burglar’s bag. “No more valuables to be taken care of?”<br>“Put those items back! Now! Or I’ll have your job, I swear it!”<br>“I’ll take that as a no. Breakfast is <-<-<-<eight 𝘴𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘱>->->->. Boiled eggs with toast soldiers today. None for the tardy.”"
"Last night I left a letter under the manager’s day-office door—he’ll find it at <-<-<-<eight A.M.>->->-> tomorrow—informing him of the change in my existential status, so with luck an innocent chambermaid will be spared an unpleasant surprise. See, I do think of the little people."
"This morning I plain don’t remember. They got enough of those things they call pills down me so I don’t know a thing till I hear the ward door open. That ward door opening means it’s at least <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->, means there’s been maybe an hour and a half I was out cold in that Seclusion Room when the technicians could of come in and installed anything the Big Nurse ordered and I wouldn’t have the slightest notion what."
"“Agh ...” I gasped hoarsely, turning over onto my back. Through the heavy curtains I couldn’t see whether it was still night or the day was well advanced. I squinted at the clock: The glowing figures showed <-<-<-<eight>->->->."
"<-<-<-<Eight o’clock>->->-> the walls whirr and hum into full swing. The speaker in the ceiling says, “Medications,” using the Big Nurse’s voice."
"“I’ll give you a ride, of course!” Sarah said, slapping Kendra’s shoulder. “It’s really no problem.”<br>Kendra grabbed where she’d been slapped. “We start at <-<-<-<eight>->->->?” she said, kneading her shoulder."
"It was only <-<-<-<eight in the morning>->->->, too early for the lazy sods on the board to show up for their stab at municipal work. Still, the wee hour didn’t stop Thomas from kicking the blue council doors in unadulterated rage before retreating to his Land Rover to await Councilman Padraig Carey’s arrival."
"A man who had been in motion since <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> in the morning, and might now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!"
"They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten o’clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were not yet dressed.<br>Natásha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at <-<-<-<eight>->->-> that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day."
"At <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> the wind was blowing more strongly, but Lombard did not hear it. He was asleep again."
"I'm not crying, Maria said when Carter called from the desert at <-<-<-<8 a.m.>->->-> ""I'm perfectly alright"".<br>""You don't sound perfectly alright"""
<-<-<-<8.00 a.m.>->->-> Put school clothes on
At <-<-<-<8 o'clock>->->-> on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good.
"<-<-<-<At eight o’clock>->->->, a shaft of daylight came to wake us. The thousand facets of the lava on the rock face picked it up as it passed, scattering like a shower of sparks."
"But for now it was still <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->->, and as I walked along the avenue under that brilliant blue sky, I was happy, my friends, as happy as any man who had ever lived."
"By <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->-> Stillman would come out, always in his long brown overcoat, carrying a large, old-fashioned carpet bag. For two weeks this routine did not vary. The old man would wander through the streets of the neighbourhood, advancing slowly, sometimes by the merest of increments, pausing, moving on again, pausing once more, as though each step had to be weighed and measured before it could take its place among the sum total of steps."
"Dressed in sweater, anorak and long johns, he lay in bed, hemmed in on three sides by chunky wooden beams, and ate all the salted snacks in the minibar, and then all the sugary snacks, and when he was woken by reception <-<-<-<at eight>->->-> the following morning to be told that everyone was waiting for him downstairs, the wrapper of a Mars bar was still folded in his fist."
"I hear noise at the ward door, off up the hall out of my sight. That ward door starts opening <-<-<-<at eight>->->-> and opens and closes a thousand times a day, kashash, click."
"Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->-> in the parlour behind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread-and-butter on a sack of peas in the front premises."
"Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after <-<-<-<eight o'clock a.m.>->->->; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive, before I assigned to her all that property."
"So here I'll watch the night and wait<br>To see the morning shine,<br>When he will hear the stroke of <-<-<-<eight>->->-><br>And not the stroke of nine;"
"Someone must have been telling lies about Joseph K. for without having done anything wrong he was arrested one fine morning. His landlady's cook, who always brought him breakfast at <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->->, failed to appear on this occasion."
"The next morning I woke up at <-<-<-<oh eight oh oh hours>->->->, my brothers, and as I still felt shagged and fagged and fashed and bashed and as my glazzies were stuck together real horrorshow with sleepglue, I thought I would not go to school."
"Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky--Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world-- woke up at his usual hour, that is, at <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->-> in the morning, not in his wife's bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study."
"It was a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the sitting-room to eleven minutes past ten; those of the carriage clock on the bookshelf to fourteen minutes to six. In other words, it was <-<-<-<exactly eight>->->->; and Mrs. Hignett acknowledged the fact by moving her head on the pillow, opening her eyes, and sitting up in bed. She always woke at eight precisely."
"When he opened the windows in the morning, the sky was as overcast as it had been, but the air seemed fresher, and regret set in. Had giving notice not been impetuous and wrongheaded, the result of an inconsequential indisposition? If he had held off a bit, if he had not been so quick to lose heart, if he had instead tried to adjust to the air or wait for the weather to improve, he would now have been free of stress and strain and looking forward to a morning on the beach like the one the day before. Too late. He must go on wanting what he had wanted yesterday. He dressed and rode down to the ground floor at <-<-<-<eight>->->-> for breakfast."
"Eight-one, tick-tock, <-<-<-<eight-one>->->-> o'clock, off to school, off to work, run, run, eight-one!"
"<-<-<-<8:01 A.M.>->->-><br>Dore Peretz’ chest still felt like it was on fire, a burning sensation that seemed to spread across the entire front of his torso; in fact, he felt like shit."
"<-<-<-<Eight oh two>->->-> eh em, Death of Corporal Littlebottombottom ... Eight oh three eh em ... Death of Sergeant Detritus ... Eight oh threethreethree eh em and seven seconds seconds ... Death of Constable Visit ... Eight oh three eh em and nineninenine seconds ... Death of death of death of ..."
"When he had finished the last mouthful, Scott checked his watch: <-<-<-<three minutes past eight>->->->—just enough time for coffee before grabbing a taxi to the airport."
"Yes, well. Obviously she's dead and it's very recent. Within the last two hours, if you press me. But you must have come to that conclusion yourselves or you wouldn't have cut her down. When did you say you found her? <-<-<-<Three minutes after eight>->->->."
"<-<-<-<8:03 A.M.>->->-><br>People in Evanston moved so goddamn slow. it was one thing when the sidewalks were covered in ice and lake-effect snow. But this was June, the day after Braque’s cousin Eva’s birthday, which used to mean a big family party marking the beginning of summer, at least before her dad left and her brother Randy went into rehab."
"Eight oh two eh em, Death of Corporal Littlebottombottom ... <-<-<-<Eight oh three>->->-> eh em ... Death of Sergeant Detritus ... Eight oh threethreethree eh em and seven seconds seconds ...

"He taught me that if I had to meet someone for an appointment, I must refuse to follow the ""stupid human habit"" of arbitrarily choosing a time based on fifteen-minute intervals. ""Never meet people at 7:45 or 6:30, Jasper, but pick times like 7:12 and <-<-<-<8:03>->->->!"""
"I might talk to the GP about getting some sleeping pills. I noticed that my watch had stopped at <-<-<-<three minutes past eight>->->->, and I wondered if that was the exact time our baby died."
"<-<-<-<8:04 A.M.>->->-><br>The phone was ringing, but Mark was still in a deep sleep. It continued to ring."
"Every clerk had his particular schedule of hours, which coincided with a single pair of tram runs coming from the city: A had to come in at 8, B at <-<-<-<8:04>->->->, C at 8:08 and so on, and the same for quitting times, in such a manner that never would two colleagues have the opportunity to travel in the same tramcar."
<-<-<-<8.05 a.m.>->->-> Pack school bag
"Well, it’s <-<-<-<five-past eight>->->-> now, I said to Drake. ""You’d better go straight off and organise a flashing party. There’s not a hope of a sortie tonight at sea, but we’d better be on the safe side."""
I had a restless night with some fever and was a little late starting out. It was <-<-<-<six minutes past eight>->->-> when I arrived at the lighthouse. I was unable to gain entry. The door was locked.
It was <-<-<-<seven minutes past eight>->->-> when Lara saw Betty Jeffries hurrying towards the school with her children in tow.
"Every clerk had his particular schedule of hours, which coincided with a single pair of tram runs coming from the city: A had to come in at 8, B at 8:04, C at <-<-<-<8:08>->->-> and so on, and the same for quitting times, in such a manner that never would two colleagues have the opportunity to travel in the same tramcar."
"He looked across at his son. ‘You been booking in all those names, the way I taught you?’<br>‘Sure have, Dad. Mr Parnell, 7.47; Mr Parker, <-<-<-<8.09>->->->; Mr Tudor-Jones, 8.11; Mr Alexander, 8.23.’"
He followed the squeals down a hallway. A wall clock read <-<-<-<8:09>->->-> - 10:09 Dallas time.
"She said, ""Hey sleepy head, time to get up. A Navy SEAL made breakfast, and I don't think you're supposed to be late.""<br>""Aye, aye. What time is it?""<br>She glanced at the digital clock on her nightstand. ""<-<-<-<8:10>->->->."""
"Sloane, with his shoulder punctured, was on another lounge. He was half delirious, and kept calling something about a chemistry lecture at <-<-<-<8:10.>->->->"
<-<-<-<8.10 a.m.>->->-> Read book or watch video
"Cell count down to 400,000. Woke <-<-<-<8:10>->->->. To sleep 7:15. (Appear to have lost my watch without realising it, had to drive into town to buy another.)"
"He looked across at his son. ‘You been booking in all those names, the way I taught you?’<br>‘Sure have, Dad. Mr Parnell, 7.47; Mr Parker, 8.09; Mr Tudor-Jones, <-<-<-<8.11>->->->; Mr Alexander, 8.23.’"
"Care for a turn on the engine? he called to the doxies, and pointed up at the footplate. They laughed but voted not to, climbing up with their bathtub into one of the rattlers instead. They both had very fetching hats, with one flower apiece, but the prettiness of their faces made you think it was more. For some reason they both wore white rosettes pinned to their dresses. I looked again at the clock: <-<-<-<eight-eleven>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<8:12 a.m.>->->->, just before the moment of pff, all the business of the cellars was being transacted - garbage transferred from small cans into large ones; early wide-awake grandmas, rocky with insomnia, dumped wash into the big tubs; boys in swimming trunks rolled baby carriages out into the cool morning."
"At <-<-<-<8:13 a.m.>->->-> the alarm clock in the laboratory gave the ringing word. Eddie touched a button in the substructure of an ordinary glass coffeepot, from whose spout two tubes proceeded into the wall."
"At <-<-<-<fourteen minutes past eight>->->->, a man came in, wearing a sheepskin coat. He was sucking on a hand-rolled cigarette. The man stuck out his hand, cheerfully. ""You'll be Mister Moon,"" he said."
"<-<-<-<8:14 A.M.>->->-><br>""What happened?"" Ramirez asked. Helling had alerted him by walkie-talkie and summoned him to the lobby. There the Germans were returning, Henes Sommer covered with blood and being carried by Rudolph Schindler and Peter Maier."
"“Get me the head of the Secret Service at the White House.”<br>“Yes, sir.”<br>The Director glanced at his watch: 7:10. Andrews was due at <-<-<-<8:15>->->->. The phone rang."
"No one at the desk asked Louis for identification or payment. An elderly woman showed him to a tiny, spotlessly clean room, and left without offering a word. The earliest direct flight from Prague to Vienna left at <-<-<-<8:15 a.m.>->->->, and Most had decided that Louis should not spend the intervening hours waiting in an airport lounge."
"Casey Kingsley wasn’t entirely surprised to see his new hire sitting outside his office when he arrived at <-<-<-<quarter past eight>->->-> that morning. Nor was he surprised to see the bottle Torrance was holding in his hands, first twisting the cap off, then putting it back on and turning it tight again—he’d had that special look from the start, the thousand-yard Kappy’s Discount Liquor Store stare."
"It was in the winter when this happened, very near the shortest day, and a week of fog into the bargain, so the fact that it was still very dark when George woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the time. He reached up, and hauled down his watch. It was a <-<-<-<quarter-past eight>->->->."
"You scrutinized your wrist: ""It's <-<-<-<eight fifteen>->->->. (And here time forked.) I'll turn it on."" The screen in its blank broth evolved a lifelike blur, and music welled."
"I walk through the fruit trees toward a huge, square, brown patch of earth with vegetation growing in serried rows. These must be the vegetables. I prod one of them cautiously with my foot. It could be a cabbage or a lettuce. Or the leaves of something growing underground, maybe. To be honest, it could be an alien. I have no idea. I sit down on a mossy wooden bench and look at a nearby bush covered in white flowers. Mm. Pretty. Now what? What do people do in their gardens? I feel I should have something to read. Or someone to call. My fingers are itching to move. I look at my watch. Still only <-<-<-<eight sixteen>->->->. Oh God."
"“Then let’s get going,” said T. Hamilton McKenzie. He checked his watch. It was <-<-<-<8:17>->->->. With a bit of luck he might still make the meeting on time."
He caught the <-<-<-<8:17>->->-> train so favored by those who commute from Oxford to London every day. All the people at breakfast seemed to know each other and Stephen felt like an uninvited guest at someone else’s party.
"Lil: Morning, shug. Check the mailbox<br>Me: It’s literally <-<-<-<8:17 AM>->->-><br>Lil: It’s early, I know. Left something for you when I was out walking. I suggest you get it now."
"Breakfast over, my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook, intended for scientific observations. He consulted his instruments, and recorded:<br>“Monday, July 1.<br>“Chronometer, <-<-<-<8.17 a.m.>->->->; barometer, 297 in.; thermometer, 6° (43° F.). Direction, E.S.E.”<br>This last observation applied to the dark gallery, and was indicated by the compass."
"Come on, I can't give up yet. I'll just sit here for a bit and enjoy the peace. I lean back and watch a little speckled bird pecking the ground nearby for a while. Then I look at my watch again: <-<-<-<eight seventeen>->->->. I can't do this."
Say they left at seventeen or <-<-<-<eighteen minutes past eight>->->->. In that case they must have followed Joanne Garland and might well be driving faster than she.
At <-<-<-<8:19>->->-> she received a second phone call to let her know the plane had taken off from Amman with the “cargo” on board.
"I had arranged to meet the Occupational Health Officer at 10:30. I took the train from Watford Junction at <-<-<-<8.19>->->-> and arrived at London Euston seven minutes late, at 8.49."
He had watched the early-morning commuters flooding in on every train. By <-<-<-<twenty past eight>->->-> Adam judged they were at their peak. He checked that the icon was in place and left his hideout to join the flood as they headed to work.
"This morning I took the launch out for forty minutes or so to test the engine. She's been giving a bit of trouble. That took from seven-forty-five until <-<-<-<twenty past eight>->->->, near enough."
"At each end of the forecourt the two great globes of light supported by bronze dolphins threw shining pools on the heaving surface of the water which as she watched shimmered like a great cloak of black satin, shaken, smoothed and gently billowed by an invisible hand. Mandy glanced at her watch: <-<-<-<8:20>->->->."
<-<-<-<Eight-twenty>->->-> the cards and puzzles go out.
"When the typewriters happen to pause (<-<-<-<8:20>->->-> and other mythical hours), and there are no flights of American bombers in the sky, and the motor traffic's not too heavy in Oxford Street, you can hear winter birds cheeping outside, busy at the feeders the girls have put up."
"Daisy Flory made her 999 call at <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes past eight>->->->, within a few minutes of their leaving."
"He looked across at his son. ‘You been booking in all those names, the way I taught you?’<br>‘Sure have, Dad. Mr Parnell, 7.47; Mr Parker, 8.09; Mr Tudor-Jones, 8.11; Mr Alexander, <-<-<-<8.23>->->->.’"
"And then Wedderburn looked at his watch. ""<-<-<-<Twenty-three minutes past eight>->->->. I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, so that there is plenty of time. I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket - it is quite warm enough - and my grey felt hat and brown shoes.”"
"It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club - all the details of service, the tea and toast at <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes past eight>->->->, the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten."
At <-<-<-<8:23>->->-> there seemed every chance of a lasting alliance starting between Florin and Guilder. At 8:24 the two nations were very close to war.
At 8:23 there seemed every chance of a lasting alliance starting between Florin and Guilder. At <-<-<-<8:24>->->-> the two nations were very close to war.
"At <-<-<-<eight twenty-four>->->-> the senior partner walked in.<br>“I must apologize for keeping you away from your desks,” he began, “but this was not something that I felt could be covered by an internal memo, or slipped into my monthly report.”"
"Alex checked his watch as the waitress returned with his order: <-<-<-<8:24 a.m.>->->-> He planned to enter the building for the first time at 8:55. He looked around the diner and wondered how many of the other customers worked at the bank, and were aware that their new chairman was sitting in one of the booths."
There was one hell of a lot of things he was going to do next week. He glanced at his watch: <-<-<-<8:25>->->->. No Wheaties this morning.
"The twenty-five minutes from eight until <-<-<-<eight twenty-five>->->-> was the only time in which all the female suspects had been together, eating under the eye of Miss Collins and full in each other's gaze."
<-<-<-<Eight-twenty-five>->->-> some Acute mentions he used to watch his sister taking her bath; the three guys at the table with him fall over each other to see who gets to write it in the log book.
"The next day, Jay sat at his desk promptly at eight. At <-<-<-<twenty-five after>->->->, Irene came over. ""Time to go to the meeting.""<br>Jay stood. ""Who'll take over the phones?"""
"He turned around and asked the youth, “What’s the time?” The young man looked proudly at his new acquisition, which he hadn’t taken his eyes off for one moment.<br>“<-<-<-<Twenty-six minutes after eight>->->-> and twenty seconds.”"
"It exploded much later than intended, probably a good twelve hours later, at <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes past eight>->->-> on Monday morning. Several defunct wristwatches, the property of victims, confirmed the time. As with its predecessors over the last few months, there had been no warning."
"On arriving at platform one at Sevenoaks station, he would purchase a copy of the Daily Express before boarding the <-<-<-<8:27>->->-> to Cannon Street."
"Even dawdling over breakfast with my mother just killed an hour, and though I hadn't planned to be at Marge's until nine, I was knocking on her door at <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past eight>->->->."
"The lecture was to be given tomorrow, and it was now <-<-<-<almost eight-thirty>->->->."
"And at <-<-<-<8.28>->->-> on the following morning, with a novel chilliness about the upper lip, and a vast excess of strength and spirits, I was sitting in a third-class carriage, bound for Germany, and dressed as a young sea-man, in a pea-jacket, peaked cap, and comforter."
"“If you get past eleven o’clock, young man, I think you have a good chance for a long and healthy life, but we still don’t know if it’s Dexter or Harrison. You know I think it’s Dexter.” The Director looked at his watch again: <-<-<-<8:29>->->->—ninety-seven minutes left."
"Mr. Trent himself followed a rigid routine. Each day, he arose at 7 a.m., breakfasted at 7:30, and departed for work at 8:10, arriving at <-<-<-<8:29>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<8.29>->->-> I punched the front doorbell in Elgin Crescent. It was opened by a small oriental woman in a white apron. She showed me into a large, empty sitting room with an open fire and a couple of huge oil paintings."
"Gard stood bent over the cut in the earth for some time, shining the big light into the black depths. Here it was, only <-<-<-<eight-thirty in the morning>->->->, and already he wanted a drink."
"At <-<-<-<half past eight>->->-> Millicent Hammitt barged in, without a preliminary knock, to say goodbye."
"Sir John was normally awakened at <-<-<-<half past eight>->->-> every morning by a butler who brought him his breakfast, another butler who brought him his clothes, a third butler whose job it was to feed Adolf and Stalin if necessary, and a fourth butler who was basically a spare."
"Outside, the wind continued to rise. Every now and then it gave a blood-curdling scream around the eaves that made him look up from his book. Around <-<-<-<eight thirty>->->->, the snow began. It was heavy and wet, quickly coating his window and blocking his view of the mountains. In a way, that was worse. The snow had blocked the windows in the Overlook, too."
"We had made our arrangements at lunch the day before, and when I turned my old car into the driveway of the big green Victorian at <-<-<-<eight-thirty>->->-> on Tuesday morning, Annie and Mike were ready to go. So was Milo."
"At <-<-<-<eight thirty>->->->, I called and said, “I’ve been thinking I might get a boob job, just take them clean off. What do you think? Could I pull off the flat-chested look?”"
"<-<-<-<Eight-thirty>->->-> the ward door opens and two technicians trot in, smelling like grape wine; technicians always move at a fast walk or a trot because they’re always leaning so far forward they have to move fast to keep standing."
"At <-<-<-<8:30 A.M.>->->-> Filomina walked into the Ale House white, round, and heaving from the extra hundred and forty-six pounds she carried on her small frame."
"“What nonsense!” thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch.<br>It was <-<-<-<half-past eight>->->-> already."
"At <-<-<-<half past eight>->->->, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls."
"It is around <-<-<-<8:30>->->->. Sunshine comes through the windows at right. As the curtain rises, the family has just finished breakfast."
"On July 25th, <-<-<-<8:30 a.m.>->->-> the bitch Novaya dies whelping. At 10 o'clock she is lowered into her cool grave, at 7:30 that same evening we see our first floes and greet them wishing they were the last."
"The lecture was to be given tomorrow, and it was now almost <-<-<-<eight-thirty>->->->."
"When he woke, at <-<-<-<eight-thirty>->->->, he was alone in the bedroom. He put on his dressing gown and put in his hearing aid and went into the living room."
"I can see by my watch, without taking my hand from the left grip of the cycle, that it is <-<-<-<eight-thirty>->->-> in the morning."
"At <-<-<-<8:31 a.m.>->->->, MST, a woman on TWA's Flight 196 burst into tears and began to bugle her own opinion, which was perhaps not unshared among some other passengers (or even the crew, for that matter), that the plane was going to crash."
"He woke again with a start when the hardback of The Last Chronicle of Barset thudded to the ground. Fumbling for his watch, he saw with dismay that it was <-<-<-<eight thirty-two>->->->, a late start to the day."
"It’s <-<-<-<8:32 a.m.>->->-> on the twenty-fourth of December and Henry and I are on our way to Meadowlark House for Christmas. It’s a beautiful clear day, no snow here in Chicago, but six inches on the ground in South Haven."
"Does anybody know the time a little more exactly is what I'm wondering, Don, since Day doesn't.<br>Gately checks his cheap digital, head still hung over the sofa's arm. ""I got <-<-<-<0832>->->->:14, 15, 16, Randy.""<br>""'ks a lot, D.G. man."""
<-<-<-<8.32 a.m.>->->-> Catch bus to school
"He began his descent at <-<-<-<8:33>->->->, and was at the gate on schedule for the first time in months. When he had turned the engine off, three men immediately blocked the gangway and remained there until the Deputy Director and his party were well inside the terminal."
"It’s too late for any TV because of the cake, watch says it is <-<-<-<08:33>->->->. My yellow hoody nearly rips my head off when Ma is pulling it."
At <-<-<-<08:34 hours>->->-> precisely General Conrad Pyne's black official Rover 800 stopped outside the ugly wrought iron barrier that guarded the entrance into Downing Street.
Delivery had been by messenger service and the office stamp showed <-<-<-<8.35 a.m.>->->-> as the time out. I opened the envelope and drew out the shiny 4¼ by 3¼ photo that was all there was inside.
"It was <-<-<-<thirty-five minutes past eight>->->-> by the big clock of the central building when Mathieu crossed the yard towards the office which he occupied as chief designer. For eight years he had been employed at the works where, after a brilliant and special course of study, he had made his beginning as assistant draughtsman when but nineteen years old, receiving at that time a salary of one hundred francs a month."
"OLD GUMMY GRANNY: (THRUSTS A DAGGER TOWARDS STEPHEN'S HAND) Remove him, acushla. At <-<-<-<8.35 a.m.>->->-> you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (SHE PRAYS) O good God, take him!"
"The first maroon had been fired at <-<-<-<08.36>->->-> and the second a few moments later. The puffs of green smoke from the maroons were still hanging in the sky above when Pete arrived, breathless but still running."
"Pierce got to his feet and took his watch from his waistcoat, an incongruously clean gold object at the end of a soot-black chain. He snapped it open: it was <-<-<-<8:37>->->->."
"Friday <-<-<-<8:37 A.M.>->->-><br>As Vance stepped off the motorized cart, the hangar around him was shrouded in white vapor. The swirling cloud on the ground, the eerie chiaroscuro of the lights, the amplified voice that ticked off the countdown—all added to the other-worldliness of the scene."
"<-<-<-<Eight thirty-seven>->->-> a.m., Patrice Lane, Biohazard: The dog's clean. The Good Samaritan was a woman with an accent of some sort. Why haven't you called me?"
"Vasquez's car was stopped at Carfraemill - at <-<-<-<08:38 hours>->->->, he pointed out.<br>""Aye -annd-?""<br>""Heading north, mon!"" he snapped"
"<-<-<-<8:39 A.M.>->->-><br>""It's a go in five,"" Caroline Shaeffer announced in a stage whisper, leaning over his shoulder. A blond Ohio debutante, she was press secretary—a job she had fought for and loved —and she structured the President's media appearances with the bloodless efficiency of a Nazi drill sergeant."
"This is because when the first shot was fired at <-<-<-<8:39 A.M.>->->->, I was sleeping beside my girlfriend, Carmen, as bourbon soaked our livers, coke drip lingered in our throats, and her birth control eliminated the risk of getting pregnant on a night we would scarcely remember. As haram of a night as one could live; I might as well have changed my name to Patrick and launched a blog for atheists."
"Doug McGuire noticed the early hour, <-<-<-<8:39 A.M.>->->-> on the one wall clock that gave Daylight Savings Time for the East Coast."
"He left the Sherry-Netherland just after <-<-<-<8:40>->->->, and by the time he reached Lexington, he was just about ready to face the headmaster’s wrath."
"At <-<-<-<8:40 A.M.>->->-> she was wheeled out on a stretcher headed for Mayo General Hospital, blistered and burned by a tanning bed turned torture chamber."
"At this moment the clock indicated <-<-<-<8.40>->->->. ""Five minutes more,"" said Andrew Stuart. The five friends looked at each other. One may surmise that their heart-beats were slightly accelerated, for, even for bold gamblers, the stake was a large one."
"It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped at <-<-<-<twenty minutes to nine>->->->, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine."
"It’s <-<-<-<08:41>->->-> and I’m in Bed practicing. Ma’s filled a plastic bag with really hot water and tied it tight so none spills out, she puts it in another bag and ties that too."
"By <-<-<-<forty-one minutes past eight>->->-> we are five hundred yards from the water’s edge, and between our road and the foot of the mountain we descry the piled-up remains of a ruined tower."
"“Yeah, I was just thinking . . .”<br>Shan stole a glance at the pendulum wall clock. <-<-<-<Eight forty-two>->->->. Eighteen minutes before he’d be escorted back. “I’m worried I left the drip hose on. If Ranger Roy gets here early, tell him I’ll be back in a few.”"
"When Black himself finally appeared at <-<-<-<eighteen minutes to nine>->->->, she became very engrossed in the details of Wednesday's surveillance. So engrossed, in fact, the she barely noticed him standing in the door of her space until he spoke."
"“Either way, he mustn’t be allowed to return to the White House.” The line went dead. Cavalli knew that his father was right on both counts. Cavalli checked his watch again: <-<-<-<8:43>->->->."
"You understand this tape recorder is on?<br>""Uh huh""<br>""And it's Wednesday, May 15, at <-<-<-<eight forty-three>->->-> in the mornin'.""<br>""If you say so"""
<-<-<-<8.43 a.m.>->->-> Go past tropical fish shop
"Several soldiers - some with their uniforms unbuttoned - were looking over a motorcycle, arguing about it. The sergeant looked at his watch; it was <-<-<-<eight forty-four>->->->. They had to wait until nine. Hladik, feeling more insignificant than ill-fortuned, sat down on a pile of firewood."
DAVID ARRIVED AT the office at 9 A.M. on Monday to find that the front door was locked. He could not understand it. The secretaries were supposed to be in by <-<-<-<8:45>->->->.
"The bodies were discovered at <-<-<-<eight forty-five>->->-> on the morning of Wednesday 18 September by Miss Emily Wharton, a sixty-five-year-old spinster of the parish of St. Matthew's in Paddington, London, and Darren Wilkes, aged ten, of no particular parish as far as he knew or cared."
"When Gardner woke up, bright light was streaming into his face through the western window. His back hurt like a bastard, and when he stood up his neck gave a wretched arthritic creak that made him wince. It was <-<-<-<quarter of nine>->->->."
"When it got to be <-<-<-<a quarter to nine>->->-> and still no one had shown up, Gardener began to wonder if maybe they were quitting. He toyed with the idea as he sat in Bobbi’s rocker on the porch, fingering the big, puffy bruise on the side of his face where Bozeman had clouted him."
"At <-<-<-<eight forty-five>->->->, I called and said, “I need some financial advice. Actually, I’m serious. I’m in a bind.”"
"He paid the waitress and left the café. It was <-<-<-<8:45>->->->. The sun pressed against the inside of a thin layer of cloud. He unbuttoned his jacket as he hurried down Queensway. His mind, unleashed, sprang forwards."
"Petrov undoubtedly had the remote, so there was no question now that the asshole had reset the time from <-<-<-<08:46>->->-> to. . . now."
<-<-<-<8:47 a.m.>->->-> Just had fag. But no-smoking day does not start officially till have got dressed.
"Just on my way to the cottage. It's, er, . . .<-<-<-<8.47>->->->. Bit misty on the roads."
"Surely if she walked down Swane Street and down Leeds Road, she could go into the old door, up the old steps and slip into her old chair, gather up her old stock of paper and scent and gum, and just go on with her work where she had left off? But it was <-<-<-<twelve minutes to nine>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<8:49>->->-> there was a loud rap on the door, and Sir Hamish muttered an inaudible reproach as David Heath went to open it. He found his contact standing there."
"I had arranged to meet the Occupational Health Officer at 10:30. I took the train from Watford Junction at 8.19 and arrived at London Euston seven minutes late, at <-<-<-<8.49>->->->."
At <-<-<-<ten minutes to nine>->->-> the mail van stopped outside Sprogg's Cottage on the outskirts of Chevisham to deliver a single letter.
"He knew it was central to the pope's visit. When it arrived at <-<-<-<8:50 AM>->->-> on Tuesday morning, Carolan's secretary handed it to him. The bishop asked her to close the door as she left his office."
"He rang up his servant, dressed in haste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late. As he drove up to the Karenins’ entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was <-<-<-<ten minutes to nine>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<ten to nine>->->-> the clerks began to arrive. When they had hung up their coats and hats they came to the fireplace and stood warming themselves. If there was no fire, they stood there all the same"
"It was <-<-<-<8:50>->->-> in the morning and Bernie and I were alone on an Astoria side street, not far from a sandwich shop that sold a sopressatta sub called ""The Bypass"". I used to eat that sandwich weekly, wash it down with espresso soda, smoke a cigarette, go for a jog. Now I was too near the joke to order the sandwich, and my son's preschool in the throes of doctrinal schism."
"Punctually at <-<-<-<ten minutes to nine>->->->, a quarter hour after early mass, the boy stood in his Sunday uniform outside his father's door."
"<-<-<-<8:51 A.M.>->->-><br>Braque had never been at Whole Foods this time of morning before. It was way less slammed with rubes than at lunchtime. It sucked balls having to skip weight training, but after vomiting, she needed two bananas, reverse-osmosis water, and a protein shake to replenish, along with an extra protein shake for Patricia to make it up to her."
<-<-<-<8.51 a.m.>->->-> Arrive at school
"Message one. Tuesday, <-<-<-<8.52 am>->->->. Is anybody there? Hello?"
Ross looked out of the window to see Diego Martinez running flat out along the track toward the station. He checked his watch: <-<-<-<8:53 a.m.>->->->
"Friday <-<-<-<8:53 A.M.>->->-><br>Vance stared at the small army facing him, including Tanzan Mino and his two pilots. This definitely was not the drill. Something had gone very, very wrong. Had some of the Soviet ground crews lost their nerve and talked? Whatever had happened, things were headed off the track."
"He had to fork out almost a pound on a taxi to make sure he arrived at the police station at <-<-<-<8:54 a.m.>->->-> A young constable took him straight through to Detective Sergeant Warwick’s office, and not an interview room."
"Are you aware that at <-<-<-<08.54>->->-> Carthedian standard time yesterday, a report was received from Captain J.L. Gafeska of the cargo ship Axious that the occupants of charter ship KS55NZ/4 were found dead aboard said charter ship?"
"But it was <-<-<-<8.55>->->-> before the telephone rang and he heard the expected voice. Caroline sounded perfectly calm; only the words were urgent.<br>""I have to see you. Now. Can you get away?"""
"She arrived at <-<-<-<five minutes to nine>->->-> and stood dripping in his aunts’ hall, a tubular bundle of baby-blue plastic from which nothing showed but her face. She was holding a damp paper sack and her large mouth was twisted in an uncertain smile. Overnight she had apparently lost some of her self-assurance."
"Sitting on his bed in the spotless, white-walled room of the disease isolation unit, Merral D’Avanos looked up at the wall clock. It was <-<-<-<five to nine>->->->. The morning’s sun streamed in past the trees. The only noise he could hear was that of sparrows squabbling on the balcony."
"Linus began to walk down the hallway slowly. Rain lashed against the windows to his left. The lights in the sconces to his right flicked slightly. His loafers squeaked on the floor. He pulled at his tie. By the time he reached the opposite end of the hallway, four minutes had passed. According to his watch, it was <-<-<-<five till nine>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<five to nine>->->->, the exam room door opened and the Stones’ pediatrician walked in. Dr. John Dalton was a fellow Dan Torrance would have recognized, although not by last name. To Dan he was just Doctor John, who made the coffee at the Thursday night Big Book meeting in North Conway."
"At <-<-<-<five minutes to nine>->->->, Jacques, in his gray butler's livery, came down the stairs and said, ""Young master, your Herr Papá is coming."""
George pulled out his watch and looked at it: it was <-<-<-<five minutes to nine>->->->!
"I filled her in on the weekend's events, and she paled when I told her about the gunshot. ""Thank the Lord you weren't hurt.""<br>We discussed the incident a few minutes longer, and then I noticed the time. <-<-<-<Four minutes before nine>->->->."
It was <-<-<-<nearly nine o'clock>->->-> and the sun was fiercer every minute.
"It was Mrs. Poppets that woke me up next morning. She said: “Do you know that it’s <-<-<-<nearly nine o’clock>->->->, sir?”<br>“Nine o’ what?” I cried, starting up.<br>“Nine o’clock,” she replied, through the keyhole. “I thought you was a- oversleeping yourselves.”"
It was no surprise that Charles Applegate rang our doorbell at <-<-<-<three minutes to nine>->->->. He had sounded like the model of dependability on the phone.
"She points up at Watch that says <-<-<-<08:57>->->->, that’s only three minutes before nine. So I run into Wardrobe and lie down on my pillow and wrap up in Blanket that’s all grey and fleecy with the red piping."
"You'll have to hurry. Many a long year before that, in one of the bygone centuries, a worthy citizen of Wrychester, Martin by name, had left a sum of money to the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral on condition that as long as ever the Cathedral stood, they should cause to be rung a bell from its smaller bell-tower for <-<-<-<three minutes before nine>->->-> o'clock every morning, all the year round."
It was <-<-<-<two minutes of nine>->->-> now - two minutes before the bombs were set to explode - and three or four people were gathered in front of the bank waiting for it to open.
"<-<-<-<One minute to nine>->->->. He took his seat at the head of the table and said, “Good morning, gentlemen. I will ask the company secretary to read the minutes of the last meeting.”"
"Bingham laughed. “Then I’ll be standing by the phone at <-<-<-<one minute to nine>->->-> on Monday,” he checked his diary, “the seventeenth of August.”"
"“The Goodwill store opens at nine,” said Dimitri. “We must be waiting outside at <-<-<-<one minute to>->->->.”"
"He would then take a hackney carriage from his home in Cadogan Gardens at exactly 8:20 and arrive in the Foreign Office at promptly <-<-<-<8:59>->->->, returning home again on the stroke of six o’clock."
She had been lying in bed reading about Sophie and Alberto's conversation on Marx and had fallen asleep. The reading lamp by the bed had been on all night. The green glowing digits on her desk alarm clock showed <-<-<-<8:59>->->->.
"No trace of Inge was found that day or night. For some the search went on all night long. Then, about <-<-<-<nine>->->-> the next morning, the bells in the belfry of Zion Church began to ring wildly."
"At <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> the parsonage buggy carried them south on the highway toward Ravelunda. Fridfeldt felt more at home north of the church hamlet. There the revival had been more evident. Down here at Vänneberga it had one of its last outposts. Beyond it lay Sörbygden where the spiritual life was of another type. There one could both smoke and confess the Savior; there the doctrine of total sinful depravity was preached, and it was said whisky might be found also among the awakened."
"Promptly at <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz."
"She thought she had seen something different about Peter, but hadn’t been able to tell exactly what it was. When Anderson woke up the next morning (at a perfectly normal <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->), she saw it almost at once."
"The storm held off until <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->, and by then Anderson was pretty sure they were going to have a good one - what Havenites called “a real Jeezer.”"
"By <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day."
"At <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> his secretary came and read him his appointments for the day.<br>When he did so this morning, though, he found him still staring at his plate with a strange expression."
"When I got off the train, I anxiously wondered where I should head for. Nightclubs were a great place to buy coke, but precious few were open at <-<-<-<nine o’clock in the morning>->->->."
"He’d woken up at <-<-<-<nine>->->->, worked for a while in his room, and then said he felt sleepy. He went to the kitchen, made some coffee, and drank it. But the coffee didn’t help.<br>“I think I’ll take a nap,” he said. “I hear a buzzing sound in the back of my head.” Those were his last words. He curled up in bed, went to sleep, and never woke up again."
"From the Palais du Louvre to the Etoile it is like a piece of music for the pianoforte. For five days I have not touched the typewriter nor looked at a book; nor have I had a single idea in my head except to go to the American Express. At <-<-<-<nine>->->-> this morning I was there, just as the doors were being opened, and again at one o’clock."
"He keeps smiling all the time, smiling like a rosy little bedbug that has had its fill. “It was <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->,” he says once again, “when I called you up, wasn’t it?” I nod my head wearily. Yes, it was nine o’clock. He is certain now that it was nine o’clock because he remembers having taken out his watch."
"At <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->, I called again. He answered.<br>“What do you want?” he asked.<br>“I was hoping to hear you say you miss me.”<br>“I miss you,” he said. “Is that it?”<br>I hung up."
"A work routine is developing. Ayrs and I are in the music room by <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> every morning his various ailments and pains let him. I sit at the piano, Ayrs on the divan, smoking his vile Turkish cigarettes, and we adopt one of our three modi operandi. ""Revisionals""—he asks me to run through the previous morning’s work. I hum, sing, or play, depending on the instrument, and Ayrs modifies the score."
"There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool."
"“Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at <-<-<-<nine>->->->.”"
It was <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air.
"The Earth was created on Sunday the 21st of October, 4004 B.C., at exactly <-<-<-<9:00 A.M.>->->->, because God liked to get work done early in the morning while he was feeling fresh."
"At only <-<-<-<nine in the morning>->->->, the kitchen was already pregnant to its capacity, every crevice and countertop overtaken by Marjan’s gourmet creations. Marinating vegetables (𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘴 of mango, eggplant, and the regular seven-spice variety), packed to the briny brims of five-gallon see-through canisters sat on the kitchen island. Large blue bowls were filled with salads (angelica lentil, tomato, cucumber and mint, and Persian fried chicken), 𝘥𝘰𝘭𝘮𝘦𝘩, and dips (cheese and walnut, yogurt and cucumber, baba ghanoush, and spicy hummus), which along with feta, Stilton, and cheddar cheeses, were covered and stacked in the enormous glass-door refrigerator."
By the time he was fully dressed it was <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->. There were six hours left until Hitler’s ultimatum expired.<br>He went in search of breakfast.
"However, at <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap, went out for his usual walk."
"It was <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear blue sky, and the sun’s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist."
When the gong sounded for breakfast at <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> it found every one up and awaiting the summons.
I could never get all the way down there before <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->->.
Look. Ignatius. I'm beat. I've been on the road since <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> yesterday morning.
"On the third morning after their arrival, just as all the clocks in the city were striking <-<-<-<nine>->->-> individually, and somewhere about nine hundred and ninety-nine collectively, Sam was taking the air in George Yard, when a queer sort of fresh painted vehicle drove up, out of which there jumped with great agility, throwing the reins to a stout man who sat beside him, a queer sort of gentleman, who seemed made for the vehicle, and the vehicle for him."
<-<-<-<9.00 a.m.>->->-> School assembly
"A fly buzzed, the wall clock began to strike. After the <-<-<-<nine>->->-> golden strokes faded, the district captain began. ""How is Herr Colonel Marek?""<br>""Thank you, Papá, he's fine.""<br>""Still weak in geometry?""<br>""Thank you, Papá, a little better.""<br>""Read any books?""<br>""Yessir, Papá."""
"As <-<-<-<nine o' clock>->->-> was left behind, the preposterousness of the delay overwhelmed me, and I went in a kind of temper to the owner and said that I thought he should sign on another cook and weigh spars and be off."
"At <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->->, one morning late in July, Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn."
"He was at breakfast at <-<-<-<nine>->->->, and for the twentieth time consulted his ""Bradshaw"", to see at what earliest hour Dr. Grantly could arrive from Barchester."
"He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!"
"It was around <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> that I crossed the border into Cornwall. This was at least three hours before the rain began and the clouds were still all of a brilliant white. In fact, many of the sights that greeted me this morning were among the most charming I have so far encountered. It was unfortunate, then, that I could not for much of the time give to them the attention they warranted; for one may as well declare it, one was in a condition of some preoccupation with the thought that - barring some unseen complication - one would be meeting Miss Kenton again before the day's end."
"Opening his window, Aschenbach thought he could smell the foul stench of the lagoon. A sudden despondency came over him. He considered leaving then and there. Once, years before, after weeks of a beautiful spring, he had been visited by this sort of weather and it so affected his health he had been obliged to flee. Was not the same listless fever setting in? The pressure in the temples, the heavy eyelids? Changing hotels again would be a nuisance, but if the wind failed to shift he could not possibly remain here. To be on the safe side, he did not unpack everything. <-<-<-<At nine>->->-> he went to breakfast in the specially designated buffet between the lobby and the dining room."
"Sometimes what I wouldn't give to have us sitting in a bar again at <-<-<-<9.00 am>->->-> telling lies to one another, far from God."
The clock struck <-<-<-<nine>->->-> when I did send the nurse; In half an hour she promised to return.
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br>With a dead sound on the final stroke of <-<-<-<nine>->->->.
"<-<-<-<Nine o’clock>->->-> young residents wearing leather elbows talk to Acutes for fifty minutes about what they did when they were little boys. The Big Nurse is suspicious of the crew-cut looks of these residents, and that fifty minutes they are on the ward is a tough time for her."
"“Good. I might just call you at <-<-<-<one minute past nine>->->-> that morning, and I may be able to repay several of your favors.”"
"As Dexter passed under the digital clock, its red numbers clicked to <-<-<-<9:01>->->->. The doors slid open and he marched out onto the sidewalk. Three black limousines were waiting in line with drivers by their doors."
"He paced around the room, using the time to rehearse his questions, questions that mustn’t sound prepared. At <-<-<-<one minute past nine>->->->, he took the piece of paper out of his pocket and dialed the number."
"<-<-<-<9:01 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at ceiling."
"It was <-<-<-<two minutes past nine>->->->. Hanley nodded to the chief housing officer. ""Proceed,"" he said. The council officer approached the door of the house and knocked loudly."
"We were rolling down an expressway, somewhere, but rain was clouding the view of the skyline so that I couldn't orient myself to where we were. The glowing numbers of the dashboard clock said that it was only <-<-<-<a few minutes after nine>->->->."
"<-<-<-<9:02 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at ceiling."
"<-<-<-<9:03 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at ceiling."

"The greengrocer arrived on his bicycle at <-<-<-<three minutes past nine>->->->, felt in the pocket of his close-fitting denim jacket, and unlocked the door. But his back was firmly toward the street and it was impossible for Scase to get a glance at the keys."
"This isn't a very good start to the new school year. I stared at her. What was she talking about? Why was she looking at her watch? I wasn't late. Okay, the school bell had rung as I was crossing the playground, but you always get five minutes to get to your classroom.<br>""It's <-<-<-<three minutes past nine>->->->,"" Miss Beckworth announced. ""You're late."""
"<-<-<-<9:04 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at ceiling."
"In the light of a narrow-beam lantern, Pierce checked his watch. It was <-<-<-<9:04>->->->. That gave them an hour to find the key before Barlow provided his diversion to cover their escape."
"Hadn't Father Presteign said that the post came at nine or shortly after? ""Shortly after"" could mean anything. They could be waiting for half an hour. <-<-<-<Five past nine>->->->. Seven minutes past. And then it came."
"<-<-<-<9:05 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at ceiling."
"Kaldren pursues me like luminescent shadow. He has chalked up on the gateway '96,688,365,498,702'. Should confuse the mail man. Woke <-<-<-<9:05>->->->. To sleep 6:36."
"The tour of the office doesn't take that long. In fact, we're pretty much done by <-<-<-<9:05 a.m.>->->-> Ed looks at everything twice and says it's all great, and gives me a list of contacts who might be helpful, then has to leave for his own office."
"It must be done, Madeleine; I must manage to speak to him before ten o'clock to-morrow morning, for my bride is coming.<br>""The Parisienne? She coming here!""<br>""Yes, with her father, by the train which gets in at <-<-<-<six minutes past nine>->->-> to-morrow."""
"Secretly, it's only <-<-<-<six minutes past nine>->->->. I set my huge clock (oversize so that I can see without my contacts in) nine minutes fast in the hope that somehow this deception will make me on time."
"<-<-<-<9:06 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at ceiling."
"During the journey Septimus would read his newspaper and smoke two cigarettes, arriving at Cannon Street at <-<-<-<9:07>->->->."

"<-<-<-<9:07 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at ceiling."
"It was a sparkling morning, <-<-<-<9:07>->->-> by the clock when Mrs. Flett stepped aboard the Imperial Limited at the Tyndall station, certain that her life was ruined, but managing, through an effort of will, to hold herself erect and to affect an air of preoccupation and liveliness."
"What time was it? asked Edmund.<br>""<-<-<-<Between nine and ten of the clock>->->->,"" said Trumpkin.<br>""Just when we were at the railway station!"" said all the children, and looked at one another with shining eyes."
"He stopped, dried the sweat from his forehead, and took a minute to look for the sun. The day was completely gray and without shade. It must have been <-<-<-<between nine and ten>->->->. The shooting continued relentlessly up ahead. He trampled on."

"<-<-<-<9:09 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at wall."
"“Perhaps I should tie up that loose end in case the operation does go badly. It will only take a few minutes, and I’m sure there will be enough daylight left for the operation, for, according to my Pulsar, it’s only <-<-<-<nine past nine in the morning>->->->. Ha!”"
"<-<-<-<9:10 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at wall."
<-<-<-<9:10 a.m.>->->-> Suddenly realize hair is drying in a weird shape. Search for hairbrush. Locate in handbag.
These new locks yielded easily to Agar's attentions. At <-<-<-<9:11>->->-> they swung the grating door open and entered the wine cellar proper. They immediately began the search for the key.
“What train can I get?”<br>“There’s one about <-<-<-<9:11>->->-> if you really must go.”
"<-<-<-<9:11 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at wall."
"As the Jefferson Memorial came into sight Dexter checked his watch yet again. It was <-<-<-<9:12>->->->. “Easily enough time,” he remarked. Less than a minute later, they were caught in a traffic jam."
"On a Wednesday morning, then, at <-<-<-<twelve minutes past nine>->->-> EDT, the Pleiades hung poised, high over the Chancellery of Solar System Enterprises, Incorporated."
"The massive iron door didn’t swing open until <-<-<-<twelve minutes past nine>->->->. Harry leaped up as a prison guard stood to one side and allowed a tall, elegant man with silver gray hair to enter."

"<-<-<-<9:13 am>->->-> lay in bed, staring at wall."
"She tucked the phone in the crook of her neck and thumbed hurriedly through her pink messages. Dr. Provetto, at <-<-<-<9:13 A.M.>->->->"
"When Virginia woke the next morning, she found a large envelope lying on the doormat. She didn’t want to know who’d delivered it, or when. She checked her watch, <-<-<-<9:14 a.m.>->->->"

"It was only <-<-<-<9:15>->->-> in the morning but already an early mist had cleared and the sky, almost cloudless, was brightening to an opaque whiteness with glimpses of soft clear blue."
"The breakfast crowd at the Sunspot is clearing out. Soon the woman in charge, no longer sleepy-eyed, will take in the signboard with the breakfast specials and replace it with the one for the lunch specials.<br><-<-<-<Quarter past nine>->->-> and the smoke billowing above the courthouse seems to be thinning. Billy is starting to wonder if there’s been a glitch."
"It was a <-<-<-<quarter-past nine>->->-> when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street."
"Great! Jones commented. ""I've never seen it do that before. That's all right. Okay."" Jones pulled a handful of pencils from his back pocket. ""Now, I got the contact first at <-<-<-<0915>->->-> or so, and the bearing was about two-six-nine."""
"<-<-<-<9:15 am>->->-> doubled over pillow, sat up to see out window."
<-<-<-<9.15 a.m.>->->-> First morning class
Miss Pettigrew pushed open the door of the employment agency and went in as the clock struck a <-<-<-<quarter past nine>->->->.
"Thursday <-<-<-<9:16 A.M.>->->-><br>Yuri Androv stood at the far end of the flood-lit hangar, staring up at the underbelly of Daedalus I and thinking. This morning's run-up in the centrifuge had gone well. At last he was convinced there was no physiological barrier to hypersonic flight, at least none he couldn't handle."
"<-<-<-<9:16 am>->->-> sat in bed, staring out window."
"The task was allocated to the Naval tug. Not only was she a more suitable vessel than a destroyer for working close inshore among rocks, she also happened to be much nearer. She sailed from Lochmaddy at <-<-<-<09.17 hours>->->->."
"<-<-<-<9:17 am>->->-> sat in bed, staring out window."
"I've been fishin' this here ""hole"" for something like forty years, off and on, and I've found out that these here sunfish get through breakfast at exactly <-<-<-<eighteen minutes past nine>->->->."
"<-<-<-<9:18 am>->->-> sat in bed, staring out window."
"According to this, it is high-water on the full and charge at <-<-<-<nineteen minutes past nine in the morning>->->->: I observed the flood to come from southward, though at Restoration Island, I thought it came from the northward."
"<-<-<-<9:19 am>->->-> sat in bed, staring out window."
"We breakfasted together in the cottage - grapefruit, toast, and coffee - and then I came out to the surgery to wait for Oliver. He was due to give blood at nine. When he hadn't arrived by <-<-<-<nine-twenty>->->->, I began ringing round to find out what was keeping him."
"Here Miss Wharton, as was her custom each Wednesday and Friday, would weed out the dead flowers from the vase in front of the statue of the Virgin, scrape the wax and candle stubs from the brass holders, dust the two rows of chairs in the Lady Chapel, which would be adequate for the small congregation expected at that morning's early Mass, and make everything ready for the arrival at <-<-<-<nine twenty>->->-> of Father Barnes."
"At <-<-<-<twenty minutes past nine>->->->, the Duke of Dunstable, who had dined off a tray in his room, was still there, waiting for his coffee and liqueur."
"Grant knew animals often performed such mating rituals for hours at a time. They went without food, they paid attention to nothing else. . . . He glanced at his watch. <-<-<-<Nine-twenty>->->->."
I'll compromise by saying that I left home at eight and spent an hour travelling to a nine o'clock appointment. Twenty minutes later is <-<-<-<nine-twenty>->->->.
"The following morning at <-<-<-<9.20>->->-> Mr. Cribbage straightened his greasy old tie, combed his Hitler moustache and arranged the few strands of his hair across his bald patch."
"It was <-<-<-<nine twenty-one>->->->. With one minute to go, there was no sign of Herbert's mother."
"No more throwing stones at him, and I'll see you back here exactly one week from now. She looked at her watch. 'At <-<-<-<nine twenty-two>->->-> next Wednesday.'"
"Two days later, on the second of February at <-<-<-<9:22>->->-> Jerusalem time, the Dominion launched a simultaneous and massive attack on twenty-two of the worlds between Bannermere and Earth."
<-<-<-<9.23>->->->. What possessed me to buy this comb?
"Hugo drove his Bugatti through the gates of Barrington’s shipyard for the first time in over two years, at <-<-<-<9:23>->->-> the following morning. He parked in the chairman’s space before making his way up to his father’s old office."
<-<-<-<9.24>->->->. I'm swelled after that cabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.
"With that in mind, Emma left the Manor House at <-<-<-<9:25>->->-> that morning, and was driven through the gates of Barrington’s shipyard at exactly eight minutes to ten."
The <-<-<-<9:25>->->-> train from Liverpool Street was almost empty. It was still early enough for Philippa to be traveling against the commuter tide.
"The phone on his desk rang, startling him. It was <-<-<-<nine twenty-five>->->->. He hadn't realized he had been sitting as if in a fugue."
A man I would cross the street to avoid at nine o'clock - by <-<-<-<nine twenty-five>->->-> I wanted to fuck him until he wept. My legs trembled with it. My voice floated out of my mouth when I opened it to speak. The glass wall of the meeting room was huge and suddenly too transparent.
"This was the sixth equipment failure in a week, the eleventh since Nula's death. It was enormously significant. She nodded, concealing her reaction.<br>""There is also a report from the test site, madam.""<br>""Proceed.""<br>""Test flight terminated at <-<-<-<09.26 hours>->->-> at map point 45, sector 14."""
"“It must be some time since you’ve been shopping in Paris,” she had told him. “That’s just about enough for a pair of jeans and a couple of T-shirts.” Kratz had reluctantly handed over another five thousand francs.<br>At <-<-<-<9:27>->->-> the phone rang."
"<-<-<-<9:27 A.M.>->->-><br>Vance leaned back against the scrub cypress and listened to the whistle of the light wind through the granite outcroppings. He had perched himself on one of the rugged cliffs, from which he could see virtually everything that went on aboveground. Around him ants crawled, oblivious to the heat of the sun, which now seared the bone-colored rocks on all sides, while down below the languorous surf beckoned."
"From twenty minutes past nine until <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past nine>->->->, from twenty-five minutes past eleven until twenty-eight minutes past eleven, from ten minutes to three until two minutes to three the heroes of the school met in a large familiarity whose Olympian laughter awed the fearful small boy that flitted uneasily past and chilled the slouching senior that rashly paused to examine the notices in assertion of an unearned right."
"The call had been made at <-<-<-<9:28>->->->. This was one more piece of evidence, and an important one. It proved what they had suspected from the first: that the killer was in St. Anselm's."
"This clock right? he asked the butler in the hall.<br>""Yes, sir."" The clock showed <-<-<-<twenty-eight minutes past nine>->->->. ""The clocks here have to be right, sir,"" the butler added with pride and a respectful humour, on the stairs."
"It was <-<-<-<9:29>->->-> and Raphael, entering the sacristy last, found only Father Sebastian taking off his cloak before robing for the service."
It was <-<-<-<almost half past nine>->->->. At ten o'clock the morning service at the church would begin. It was time he was on his way.
"Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at <-<-<-<half-past nine>->->-> at the office of the district superintendent."
"We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice until <-<-<-<half-past nine>->->->, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house."
"Grant opened his eyes. Brilliant blue light was streaming into the building through the bars of the gate. Quartz light: the power was back on! Groggily, he looked at his watch. It was just <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->->. He’d been asleep only a couple of minutes."
"“Strictly speaking—wait a second—strictly speaking, my last round of vomiting occurred on July 14, at <-<-<-<nine thirty in the morning>->->-> when I brought up my toast, tomato salad, and milk.”"
"It was morning—<-<-<-<nine thirty A.M.>->->->—and the sun threw small, golden dots on the water. When everything was calm, the lake looked like a dark-blue mirror cutting straight through the hills, and it seemed, if she were careful, she could walk out on it and not get wet."
"The platform was deserted. He checked his watch. It was a good watch, a Rolex, given to him by his mother on his twenty-first birthday. With beautiful efficiency they had arrived at <-<-<-<9.30 a.m.>->->-> precisely. He wondered if the British delegation had taken off yet."
At <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->-> he was sitting on the edge of his bed looking at his watch. He put it to his ear. Then his lips drew back from his teeth in that curious wolf-like smile characteristic of the man. He said very softly:<br>“I think the time has come to do something about this.”
He looked at his watch; it was <-<-<-<half-past nine>->->->
"It was <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->->. In another ten minutes she would turn off the heat; then it would take a while for the water to cool. In the meantime there was nothing to do but wait. “Have you thought it through April?” Never undertake to do a thing until you’ve –“ But she needed no more advice and no more instruction. She was calm and quiet now with knowing what she had always known, what neither her parents not Aunt Claire not Frank nor anyone else had ever had to teach her: that if you wanted to do something absolutely honest, something true, it always turned out to be a thing that had to be done alone."
"The body came in at <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->-> this morning. One of Holding's men went to the house and collected it. There was nothing particularly unusual about the death. The man had had a fear of hospitals and had died at home, being cared for more than adequately by his devoted wife."
"Up the welcomingly warm morning hill we trudge, side by each, bound finally for the Hall of Fame. It's <-<-<-<9.30>->->->, and time is in fact a-wastin'."
"His phone rang at <-<-<-<9:31>->->->. Pat grabbed it, and was relieved to hear Mr. Levy’s voice on the other end of the line."
"Tuesday <-<-<-<9:31 A.M.>->->-><br>When Michael Vance walked into the third-floor trading room of Kenji Nogami's Westminster Union Bank, it had just opened for morning business. Computer screens were scrolling green numbers; traders in shirtsleeves were making their first calls to Paris and Zurich; the pounds and dollars and deutsche marks and yen were starting to flow."
"He said he couldn't say for certain of course, but that he rather thought he was. Anyhow, if he wasn't the 11.5 for Kingston, he said he was pretty confident he was the <-<-<-<9.32>->->-> for Virginia Water, or the 10 a.m. express for the Isle of Wight, or somewhere in that direction, and we should all know when we got there."
"Sandy barely made the <-<-<-<nine-thirty-two>->->-> and found a seat in no-smoking. She'd been looking forward to this visit with Lisbeth. They hadn't seen each other in months, not since January, when Sandy had returned from Jamaica. And on that day Sandy was sporting a full-blown herpes virus on her lower lip."
Harry found himself standing outside the embassy at <-<-<-<9:33 a.m.>->->->
"Next, he remembered that the morrow of Christmas would be the twenty-seventh day of the moon, and that consequently high water would be at twenty-one minutes past three, the half-ebb at a quarter past seven, low water at <-<-<-<thirty-three minutes past nine>->->->, and half flood at thirty-nine minutes past twelve."
"In another sense, on the contrary, our trains, in this latitude, gain over the sun more than 900 kilometres an hour, beating that planet hand over hand: quitting Liverpool at noon, for example, the traveler will reach the station where we now are at <-<-<-<thirty-four minutes past nine in the morning>->->-> - that is to say, earlier than he started!"
He opened the first file and began to go over the seven questions he’d written out so neatly the night before. He glanced up at the clock on the wall. It was <-<-<-<9:35 A.M.>->->->
"He proceeded to email a copy to Ron, as well as to Zack. He then finally looked at the clock in the upper right corner of his laptop. It said <-<-<-<9:35 AM>->->->."
"Tess looked at her watch and was astounded to see it was only <-<-<-<twenty-five to ten>->->->. It seemed that she had fed Fritzy double rations and left the house four years ago. Maybe five, She thought she heard an approaching engine, then decided she didn’t."
<-<-<-<Nine-thirty-five>->->->. He really must be gone. The bird is no longer feeding but sitting at the apex of a curl of razor wire.
At <-<-<-<twenty-five minutes to ten>->->-> he was tapping on the closed door of Blore’s room.<br>The latter opened it cautiously. His hair was tousled and his eyes were still dim with sleep.
It was <-<-<-<9:36>->->-> and the traffic was now flowing smoothly. He walked over to the officer coordinating the shoot for the city’s motion picture and television office.
"Danny checked Nick’s watch: <-<-<-<9:36 A.M.>->->-> He walked quickly downstairs and headed for reception, where he tried a different ploy."
"I grab a pen and the pad of paper by the phone and start scribbling a list for the day. I have an image of myself moving smoothly from task to task, brush in one hand, duster in the other, bringing order to everything. Like Mary Poppins.<br>9:30-<-<-<-<9:36>->->-> Make Geigers' bed"
"<-<-<-<9:36 a.m.>->->-> Oh God, Oh God. Maybe he's fallen in love in New York and stayed there."
"The lead car swerved between two police barriers and turned into Constitution Avenue at <-<-<-<9:37>->->->. When Dexter saw the floats lining up for the parade, he gave the order to turn the sirens off."
"It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club - all the details of service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the shaving-water at <-<-<-<thirty-seven minutes past nine>->->->, and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten."
<-<-<-<Twenty-two minutes remained [until ten o'clock]>->->->. He was just turning in upon the footpath behind the swine shed. It would take ten minutes to get to the church. He had less than fifteen minutes in which to get ready.
Exactly as the display ticked over to <-<-<-<9.39 a.m.>->->-> there was a distant banging on my front door. I hate show-offs.
"<-<-<-<9:39 A.M.>->->-><br>Braque was in the ground-floor women’s bathroom at Chapin Hall with her pants to her knees, but her whole day wasn’t f*cked yet. Yes, this was a substantial detour, but she still had an hour to make it to her last Micro 1 discussion group before the final."
The Chairman broke the circuit and lit another cigarette: <-<-<-<9:40>->->->.
"After breakfast she selected a maternity outfit that made her, with a little assistance, look about seven months pregnant. She left the hotel at <-<-<-<9:40>->->-> a.m., and took a taxi to Lafayette street, where she entered a monument to glass and steel, and, after checking the directory on the wall, took a lift to the twenty-first floor."
"His business partner rang the office at about <-<-<-<nine-forty>->->-> to say he hadn't been able to contact Robin since yesterday morning and was worried. Mrs. Frensham came over first and found the remains of a meal on the kitchen table, his car in the driveway and his bed apparently not slept in."
Hartmann closed the door of the banqueting hall and stopped to fasten his watch. It was <-<-<-<twenty minutes to ten>->->->. From the office along the corridor came a faint sound of typing; a telephone rang.
"It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club—all the details of service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at <-<-<-<twenty minutes before ten>->->->."
Must have the phone disconnected. Some contractor keeps calling me up about payment for 50 bags of cement he claims I collected ten days ago. Says he helped me load them onto a truck himself. I did drive Whitby's pick-up into town but only to get some lead screening. What does he think I'd do with all that cement? Just the sort of irritating thing you don't expect to hang over your final exit. (Moral: don't try too hard to forget Eniwetok.) Woke <-<-<-<9:40>->->->. To sleep 4:15.
"Marya looked at the time display in the lower right corner of the screen; <-<-<-<09:41>->->->, exactly eleven minutes since she entered the fabrication complex"
9:36<br>Fuck. I cannot make this bed. Why won't this sheet lie flat?<br><-<-<-<9:42>->->-><br>And why do they make mattresses so heavy?
"As it approached four seconds past <-<-<-<eighteen minutes to ten>->->-> it slowed right down, then halted altogether."
"Harry found himself standing outside the embassy at 9:33 a.m. Once around the block: <-<-<-<9:43>->->->. Once again, even slower: 9:56. Finally, he walked through the gates, across a pebbled courtyard and up a dozen steps, where a large double door was opened for him by a guard whose medals indicated that they had served in the same theater of war."
"Monday <-<-<-<9:43 A.M.>->->-><br>""Michael, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear from you, old man. We must have lunch today."" The voice emerged from the receiver in the crisp diction of London's financial district, the City, even though the speaker had been born on the opposite side of the globe."
"Friday <-<-<-<9:44 A.M.>->->-><br>""Guess we'd better start playing hide-and-seek in earnest,"" Vance observed.<br>""Stealth, my American friend,"" Androv replied. ""The hostile radar signature of this fuselage is almost nothing."""
"At <-<-<-<a quarter to ten>->->-> on the morning of August 15th, Leandro crossed into the town of Troy. His stomach was tight with anticipation and — let’s face it, folks — a tingle of fear. His skin felt cold."
She looked at the clock on the night table and saw it was <-<-<-<quarter to ten>->->->. She’d slept another two hours. For a moment she was alarmed; maybe she’d suffered a concussion or a fracture after all.
"9.15, 9.30, <-<-<-<9.45>->->->, 10! Bond felt the excitement ball up inside him like cat's fur."
"At the hour of <-<-<-<9:46 A.M.>->->->, to be exact, as one should in these matters, I had cast three times above the known lair of this fish. Then I cast a fourth time, more from habit than hope; and the fight was on."
He left the hotel at <-<-<-<9:47 A.M.>->->-> at his usual brisk pace “Action stations.”<br>Stephen and Robin snapped out of their daydreaming.
"“She’s dead,” he confirmed. “It must have been very sudden and with the minimum of pain.” He checked his watch; the time was <-<-<-<9:47>->->->. He covered his patient with a blanket and called for an ambulance."
"The timing of the Lord Chancellor’s entrance and exit from the North Tower of the Palace of Westminster would have impressed a regimental sergeant major. At <-<-<-<9:47 a.m.>->->-> there was a knock on the door and his secretary, David Bartholomew, entered the room."
"Right. . . <-<-<-<nine forty-seven>->->-> and nine forty-eight. They died at the same time.<br>""That's not the same time, Harry.""<br>I waved a hand, impatient."
When I’m hungry again I check Watch but he only says <-<-<-<09:47>->->->. Cartoons are over so I watch football and the planet where people win prizes.
"Finally at <-<-<-<9:47>->->->, the call came. Elaine answered, listened for a second, then silently handed me the receiver. “I want you to be my Secretary of State.”"
<-<-<-<9:47 a.m.>->->-> Or gone to Las Vegas and got married.
"Normally I would have been at school at <-<-<-<9.47 in the morning>->->->, but I had a doctors appointment with an ear, nose and throat specialist, who was going to tell me why I suffered so many sinus infections."
"<-<-<-<9:47 a.m.>->->-> (35 minutes captive)<br>1 lighter, 3 bottles of vodka, 1 pair of scissors, no plan."

"This is the body I first saw at <-<-<-<nine-forty-eight>->->-> on Friday the fifteenth of October at Innocent House, Innocent Walk, Wapping."
"Twenty-four hours later there was a new message on the numbers station. Porter listened to it twice before decoding it. It simply said, Message received. Assets en route. Landing tomorrow at <-<-<-<0949 hours>->->->. GCHQ listening in."

"She reaches Radiance at <-<-<-<ten to ten>->->->, early for once, and lets herself in with her key, and puts on the mauve-and-aqua smock that Shanita designed for them so the customers will know they aren’t customers themselves."
"Philip Lombard said:<br>“What’s the time now?”<br>“<-<-<-<Ten minutes to ten>->->->, sir.”<br>Lombard’s eyebrows rose. He nodded slowly to himself."
<-<-<-<9:50 a.m.>->->-> Hmmm. Think will go inspect makeup in case he does come in.
"<-<-<-<Ten minutes to ten.>->->-> ""I had just time to hide the bottle (after the nurse had left me) when you came into my room."""
"They paused in front of the great concrete blocks that had been built to house the Declaration of Independence, just as a priest might in front of an altar. Scott checked his watch. It was <-<-<-<9:51>->->->."
"<-<-<-<9:51 A.M.>->->-><br>J.J. shook his head in disgust as he looked over the shambles that was the gantry. Dr. Andros had just phoned from Command, asked him to undertake a preliminary assessment of the condition of the facility, just to ballpark the extent of damage. The assignment was already depressing him."
"She had planned to be a few minutes early, and the cab dropped her off outside the building at <-<-<-<9:51 a.m.>->->-> As she handed the driver a quarter, she was relieved that her visit to New York was coming to an end; it had turned out to be far more expensive than she had anticipated."
She caught the <-<-<-<9:52>->->-> to Victoria. I kept well clear of her on the train and picked her up as she went through the barrier.
"With that in mind, Emma left the Manor House at 9:25 that morning, and was driven through the gates of Barrington’s shipyard at exactly <-<-<-<eight minutes to ten>->->->."
People did not speak to her in such a manner. Her father was a lawyer. It was <-<-<-<seven minutes to ten>->->->.
"Miss Pettigrew went to the bus-stop to await a bus. She could not afford the fare, but she could still less afford to lose a possible situation by being late. The bus deposited her about five minutes' walk from Onslow Mansions, and at <-<-<-<seven minutes to ten>->->-> precisely she was outside her destination."
"Danny walked quickly back past the hotel, checking every intersection until he finally saw the name Argyll Street carved in large letters on a stone slab above him. He checked his watch as he turned into the street: <-<-<-<9:54>->->->."
"<-<-<-<9:54>->->-> This is sheer torture. My arms have never ached so much in my entire life. The blankets weigh a ton, and the sheets won't go straight and I have no idea how to do the wretched corners. How do chambermaids do it?"
"The car parked outside Barrington House at <-<-<-<six minutes to ten>->->->. By the time she stepped out of the lift on the fifth floor and walked down the corridor to the chairman’s office, it was two minutes to ten."

She had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day."
"At <-<-<-<five to ten>->->-> I'm ready in the hall. Nathaniel's mother's house is nearby but apparently tricky to find, so the plan is to meet here and he'll walk me over. I check my reflection in the hall mirror and wince. The streak of bleach in my hair is as obvious as ever. Am I really going out in public like this?"
"Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning, said Albert; ""your punctuality really alarms me. What do I say? punctuality! You, whom I expected last, you arrive at <-<-<-<five minutes to ten>->->->, when the time fixed was half-past! Has the ministry resigned?"""
"Harry found himself standing outside the embassy at 9:33 a.m. Once around the block: 9:43. Once again, even slower: <-<-<-<9:56>->->->. Finally, he walked through the gates, across a pebbled courtyard and up a dozen steps, where a large double door was opened for him by a guard whose medals indicated that they had served in the same theater of war."
"<-<-<-<9:56 A.M.>->->-><br>Ally stepped out of the cab, holding the large leather‑bound portfolio, and checked the number on the card against the bronze plaque above the door. Winston Bartlett lived like a nineteenth‑century robber baron."

"Friday <-<-<-<9:57 A.M.>->->-><br>""We have detonation,"" Colonel Arkadi reported into his helmet mike. His twin-engine Foxhound was already in a steep fifty-degree bank.<br>""We copy you,"" General Sokolov replied. ""Can you confirm the kill?"""

"I didn't sleep too long, because I think it was only <-<-<-<around ten o'clock>->->-> when I woke up. I felt pretty hungry as soon as I had a cigarette. The last time I'd eaten was those two hamburgers I had with Brossard and Ackley when we went in to Agerstown to the movies. That was a long time ago. It seemed like fifty years ago."
"Colonel Scott-Hopkins knocked on the door of number 44 Eaton Square at <-<-<-<one minute to ten>->->->. A few moments later, the front door was opened by a giant of a man who dwarfed the commanding officer of the SAS."
"Alex would like to have told him, just once, “Sorry, old boy, can’t make it. I’ve got a far more important appointment at that time,” but he knew he would be standing outside 44 Eaton Square at <-<-<-<one minute to ten>->->-> the following morning."

"<-<-<-<One minute to ten>->->->. With a heavy heart Bert watched the clock. His legs were still aching very badly. He could not see the hands of the clock moving, but they were creeping on all the same."
At about <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> the first tiny snowflakes came loitering down and settled on Jill’s arm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground was noticeably white.
"Shanghai’s clocks were set an hour ahead so the city could ""save daylight"", but the Bai family said: “We go by the old clock.” <-<-<-<Ten o’clock>->->-> to them was eleven to everyone else. Their singing was behind the beat; they couldn’t keep up with the huqin [Chinese string instrument] producing bleak and desolate sounds of life."
"It was at <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> to-day that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then."
"If he jumps, he thinks, he will plummet, a slow sweep through empty space, a horrible way to die. He feels, momentarily, the heat of the impact, the ghostly wet of his skull collapsing. The illusion of weightlessness gives way. The elevator rebounds shut with a clang.<br>It’s a little after <-<-<-<ten a.m.>->->-> on a Saturday."
"The <-<-<-<ten-o’clock>->->-> breakfasters began to appear: nervous, little men, morose, preoccupied, who wiped their plates with crusts of bread; rude, massive women who, like primitive idols dug out of the soil, had grown rotten in the years; flowery dandies with repulsive faces, reminding him uncomfortably of illustrations in medical tracts."
"There are some good things about living alone. The room is cool, but cool air tones up the skin. One nice thing about her job is that it doesn’t start until <-<-<-<ten>->->->, which gives her a long morning, time to grow slowly into her day."
"At <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->, he went to Shinjuku and bought a Fujitsu word processor with his credit card. It was the latest model, far lighter than earlier versions."
"It was <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall."
"Billy is ready to go early the next morning, but Bucky asks him to wait until <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> because he has an errand to run. While he does it, Billy visits the summerhouse one final time. He takes the picture of the hedge animals off the wall and carries it to the end of the path. He looks out over the gorge for a minute or two, across to the place where the reputedly haunted hotel once stood."
"That first day was a madhouse, all right. I ran the Carolina Spin with Lane until <-<-<-<10 o’clock>->->->, then alone for the next ninety minutes while he rushed around the park putting out opening day fires."
"At around <-<-<-<ten>->->-> every morning, my wife and I would take a cooler down to the beach. We’d lather up with sunblock, then sprawl out on mats on the sand. I’d listen to the Stones or Marvin Gaye on a Walkman, while my wife plowed through a paperback of Gone With the Wind. She claimed that she’d learned a lot about life from that book. I’d never read it, so I had no idea what she meant."
"“My mother in law’s not a bad person. I don’t have any negative feelings toward her. It’s just that she’s the nervous type, and has always relied too much on other people. Do you understand the situation?”<br>“I think so,” I said.<br>She crossed her legs, waiting for me to write something new on my pad. But I didn’t write anything down.<br>“She called us at <-<-<-<ten>->->-> one Sunday morning. Two Sundays—ten days—ago.”<br>At ten I turned off the TV, went back to my room, and went to sleep."
"She spent that night in Junpei’s room. They drank wine—a gift from the restaurant—had sex, and went to sleep. When Junpei woke at <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> the next morning, she was gone, leaving only an indentation like a missing memory in the pillow next to his, and a note: “I have to go to work. Get in touch with me if you like.” She included her cell phone number."
A new life opening up for me at the Villa Borghese. Only <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> and we have already had breakfast and been out for a walk.
"Anyway, when he looked at his watch again it was <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->. At ten o’clock she was lying on the divan with her boobies in her hands. That’s the way he gives it to me—in driblets."
"The heat had started in the small hours of the morning, swiftly building up. Around <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->, it had fully erupted into being, just after Turks and Greeks on each side of the Green Line had finished their morning coffees."
"By <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> she was ravenous. She cooked herself a huge brunch and ate every bite. Then she took her movie back to Blockbuster and asked if they had 𝘒𝘪𝘴𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘋𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩. They didn’t, but after ten minutes of browsing, she settled on a substitute called 𝘓𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘏𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘓𝘦𝘧𝘵."
<-<-<-<Ten o’clock>->->-> the mail comes up. Sometimes you get the torn envelope.
"Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed.<br>""Where am I, and what is the time?"" he said aloud to the ceiling.<br>""In the House of Elrond, and it is <-<-<-<ten o’clock in the morning>->->->,"" said Gandalf. ""It is the morning of October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know."""
"They brought him back to the ward about <-<-<-<ten in the morning>->->->—""Fulla piss an’ vinegar, buddies; they checked my plugs and cleaned my points, and I got a glow on like a Model T spark coil. Ever use one of those coils around Halloween time? 𝘡𝘢𝘮! Good clean fun."""
"Hours of sitting and watching, and all she had to report back to the hungry beaks of Ballinacroagh’s <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> parishioners was a sinful Benny Corcoran and a bunch of dirty tinkers. It was simply not good enough for a week’s work."
"It was <-<-<-<ten in the morning>->->->, and Lars was just about to make the drive to the old butcher shop to acquire the key ingredient for the surprise when Amy Jo and Wojtek Dragelski’s Mazda 626 pulled into a guest parking space outside."
"They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were not yet dressed.<br>Natásha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day."
"Meanwhile, the blood of the city’s saints had taken on a whole range of properties hitherto unknown to science. One lady’s was liquefying at precisely <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> every Tuesday, while San Giovanni’s bubbled away obligingly whenever it heard Holy Scripture."
"In assaying to put on his regimental coat and waistcoat, my uncle Toby found the same objection in his wig, so that went off too; So that with one thing and what with another, as always falls out when a man is in the most haste, 'twas <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->->, which was half an hour later than his usual time, before my uncle Toby sallied out."
"’Tis but <-<-<-<an hour ago since it was nine>->->->, And after one hour more ‘twill be eleven."
"For some seconds the light went on becoming brighter and brighter, and she saw everything more and more clearly and the clock ticked louder and louder until there was a terrific explosion right in her ear. Orlando leapt as if she had been violently struck on the head. Ten times she was struck. In fact it was <-<-<-<ten>->->-> o'clock in the morning. It was the eleventh of October. It was 1928. It was the present moment."
"The trial was irretrievably over; everything that could be said had been said, but he had never doubted that he would lose. The written verdict was handed down at <-<-<-<10:00>->->-> on Friday morning, and all that remained was a summing up from the reporters waiting in the corridor outside the district court."
"According to military records no US bombers or any other kind of aircraft were flying over that region at the time, that is around <-<-<-<10 am>->->-> on November 7, 1944."
"At about <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->-> in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars."
"I went to bed and the next thing I knew I was awake again and it was getting on for <-<-<-<ten o' clock>->->-> in the morning. Ring, ring, said the telephone, ring, ring."
"If Wednesday should ever come! It did come, and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for. It came - it was fine - and Catherine trod on air. By <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->->, the chaise and four conveyed the two from the abbey; and, after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles, they entered Woodston, a large and populous village, in a situation not unpleasant."
"King Richard: Well, but what's o'clock?<br>Buckingham: Upon the stroke of <-<-<-<ten>->->->."
"Monday 30 March 1668 Up betimes, and so to the office, there to do business till about <-<-<-<10 o’clock>->->->"
"On July 25th, 8:30 a.m. the bitch Novaya dies whelping. At <-<-<-<10 o'clock>->->-> she is lowered into her cool grave, at 7:30 that same evening we see our first floes and greet them wishing they were the last."
"The pundit sighed. ""Only a fool like me would leave his door open when a riot can occur at any moment, and only a fool like me would say yes to you,"" he said. ""What time?""<br>Just his head was sticking out of the partially opened door. The money from blessing the ice-cream factory must have dulled his desire for work, I thought.<br>""<-<-<-<Ten>->->->.""<br>""Ten-thirty."" Without another word, he closed the door."
The Saturday immediately preceding the examinations was a very busy day for Kennedy. At <-<-<-<ten o' clock>->->-> he was entering Willey's room; the latter had given him a key and left the room vacant by previous arrangement - in fact he had taken Olivia on another house hunting trip.
The summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break out of the weariness of school-life for one day at least. With Leo Dillon and a boy named Mahoney I planned a day's mitching. Each of us saved up sixpence. We were to meet at <-<-<-<ten in the morning>->->-> on the Canal Bridge.
"“Right, go ahead,” said the Director crisply. “Report to me as soon as they’re ready but leave the final briefing to the last possible moment, and, Matt, I want no helicopters until <-<-<-<10:01>->->->. I don’t want there to be a chance of a leak of any sort; it’s our one hope of catching the assassin.”"
"He entered the lawyer’s glass domain at <-<-<-<one minute past ten>->->->, sat down opposite his client and smiled, before placing his Gladstone bag on the floor next to his chair."
"<-<-<-<10:01 A.M.>->->-><br>Goddamn cataclysmic devastation, pretty much."
"<-<-<-<10:01 A.M.>->->-><br>Dr. Abdoul Kirwani, ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to the United States of America, sat rigidly facing the small desk in the Oval Office. When the call requesting a meeting had come from Johan Hansen's chief of staff the previous evening, he had hastily sent a secure telex to Islamabad to inquire if he needed any updating.<br>He did. And it was a disaster."
"At <-<-<-<about ten o'clock>->->-> in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.'"
"<-<-<-<10:02>->->->, her eyes rested for a split second on every person who came in."
"It was <-<-<-<two minutes after ten>->->->; she was not satisfied with her clothes, her face, her apartment. She heated the coffee again and sat down in the chair by the window. Can't do anything more now, she thought, no sense trying to improve anything the last minute."
"She passes the FBI Building at <-<-<-<three minutes past [ten]>->->->, she passes the Peace Monument at the northwest corner of the Capitol grounds at five minutes past."
"It's <-<-<-<10.03>->->-> according to his watch, and he is travelling down through the Scottish highlands to Inverness, tired and ever-so-slightly anxious in case he falls asleep between now and when the train reaches the station, and misses his cue to say to Alice, Drew and Aleesha: 'OK, this is Inverness, let's move it.'"
"The date was the 14th of May and the clock on his desk said the time was twenty three minutes past ten, so he tapped in the numbers 10.23. At least, that's what he meant to do. In fact he typed in the numbers <-<-<-<10.03>->->->."
"On Saturday. November 12. 1955, the Hill Valley Courthouses clock tower was struck by lightning, which poured 1.21 gigawatts of energy into the structure. Time stood still at <-<-<-<10:04>->->-> on the clocks face from that day on."
"She passes the FBI Building at three minutes past [ten], she passes the Peace Monument at the northwest corner of the Capitol grounds at <-<-<-<five minutes past>->->->."
"GUY KNOCKED ON George’s door, but there was no reply. He checked his watch: <-<-<-<10:05>->->->. George couldn’t be in hall having breakfast, because they finished serving at nine on a Sunday, and he surely wouldn’t have gone to the Freshers’ Fair without him."
"We both watch as a pair of swans sail regally under the little bridge. Then I glance at my watch. It's already <-<-<-<five past ten>->->->. “We should get going,” I say with a little start. Your mother will be waiting.”<br>“There's no rush,” Nathaniel calls as I hasten down the other side of the bridge. “We've got all day.” He lopes down the bridge. “It's OK. You can slow down.” I try to match his relaxed pace. But I'm not used to this easy rhythm. I'm used to striding along crowded pavements, fighting my way, pushing and elbowing."
"“All right, Matt, let’s assume that the point of maximum risk is the Capitol itself, at <-<-<-<10:06>->->->, right on the steps—what then?”"
She gets out of her car at the east front of the Capitol at <-<-<-<six minutes past [ten]>->->->.
"You have fifteen minutes, he said. Then the connection went dead. Wednesday, <-<-<-<10:06 a.m.>->->->"
"“Follow the diversion sign,” he said, without even looking at her.<br>She glanced at the clock on her dashboard. It was <-<-<-<10:07>->->->."
"“It must have been about <-<-<-<seven minutes past ten>->->->. I remember because I checked my watch when that coach left.”<br>“The coach?” said Romanov.<br>“Yes, the one that was being loaded up with musical instruments. It left about …”"
"<-<-<-<10:07 GMT>->->-><br>Once they had settled in Superintendent Wall's office, the three police officers checked and double-checked every detail of Operation Blue Period."
"<-<-<-<10:07 a.m.>->->-> Access letter only, about nonpayment of minimum payment. Try to remember what was looking for. Restart quest for handbag."
"<-<-<-<10.07 am>->->->: In a meeting with Rod, Momo and Guy. We are rehearsing the final for the third time, with Rod and Guy taking the parts of the clients, when Rod's secretary, Lorraine, bursts in."
"Chief Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh turned from his inspection of the dead girl's clothes, his six feet two inches uncomfortably trapped between the foot of the bed and the wardrobe door. He looked at his watch. It was <-<-<-<eight minutes past ten>->->->."
"My watch is always a little fast, I said. ""What time do you make it now?""<br>""<-<-<-<Ten eight>->->->.""<br>""Ten eighteen by mine. You see."""
He followed the squeals down a hallway. A wall clock read 8:09-<-<-<-<10:09>->->-> Dallas time.
"At <-<-<-<ten minutes past ten>->->-> the next morning, William received another call from his now agitated broker. Another million dollars' worth of Interstate stock had been placed on the market at the opening bell."
"At <-<-<-<10:10>->->->, two white-coated orderlies wheeled a tall, well-built man in a chair out through the swing doors and, seeing the car parked in the dean’s space, guided him towards it. The driver jumped out and quickly opened the back door. Poor man, he thought, his head all covered in bandages and only a small crack left for his lips and nostrils. He wondered if it had been burns."
"<-<-<-<10:10 A.M.>->->-><br>To Braque, the Humanities dorm was like an icicle up the glory hole. She’d put it down as her fifth choice of five. Only after getting to school did she learn that anyone who’d put it down as 𝘢𝘯𝘺 choice got stuck there."
<-<-<-<10:10>->->-> Shot is fired.
"Saturday morning was bright and sunny, and at <-<-<-<ten minutes past 10>->->-> Donald arrived at the Embankment entrance of Charing Cross Underground Station, carrying a small suitcase full of clothes suitable for outdoor sports and pastimes."
At about ten o’clock the first tiny snowflakes came loitering down and settled on Jill’s arm. <-<-<-<Ten minutes later>->->-> they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground was noticeably white.
"“Fine,” said Florentyna Kane and looked at her watch. It was <-<-<-<10:11>->->->. The digits changed—and were replaced by the rate of her heartbeat—72; normal, she thought."
"<-<-<-<10:11>->->->, had he called her bluff?"
It was a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the sitting-room to <-<-<-<eleven minutes past ten>->->->; those of the carriage clock on the bookshelf to fourteen minutes to six.
"This disappeared and the watch showed <-<-<-<10:12>->->->. The President rehearsed the opening line of her speech for the last time. She’d gone over the final draft with Edward that morning, and she was satisfied with it."
"George checked his watch: <-<-<-<10:12>->->->. Although their progress had been slower than he had anticipated, he still believed that if they could reach the summit by midday, they would have enough time to return to the North Col before sunset."
"“I'll take the coffee tray out,” I suggest humbly. As I pick it up I glance again at my watch. <-<-<-<Ten twelve>->->->. I wonder if they've started the meeting."
"He stood up once, early on, to lock his office door, and then he was reading the last page, and it was exactly <-<-<-<10:12 a.m.>->->->, and the sun beating on his office windows was a different sun from the one he'd always known."
"By the bye, said the first, ""I was able this morning to telegraph the very words of the order to my cousin at seventeen minutes past ten.""<br>""And I sent it to the Daily Telegraph at <-<-<-<thirteen minutes past ten>->->->.""<br>""Bravo, Mr. Blount!""<br>""Very good, M. Jolivet."""
"It's <-<-<-<ten-thirteen>->->->, announced Clancy. ""In two more minutes-""<br>""Post time,"" I said."
"<-<-<-<10:14>->->->, would her next appointment have to be with Mr. Brett Elders?"
"Okay. <-<-<-<Ten fourteen>->->->: Mrs. Narada reports that her cat has been attacked by a large dog. Now I send all the boys out looking, but they don't find anything until eleven. Then one of them calls in that a big dog has just bitten holes in the tires on his golf cart and run off."
"Domino two had me standing sentinel in Mr. Meek’s room watching through the crack in the door. Due to his advanced state of decay, our loyal boiler room mascot wasn’t in on the great escape, but his room was opposite mine, and he understood “Shush!” At <-<-<-<a quarter past ten>->->-> Ernie went to Reception to announce my death to Nurse Noakes."
"When she finally struggled awake—headachey, miserable, feeling hungover—the other half of the bed was empty. Bob had turned his clock back around, and she saw it was <-<-<-<quarter past ten>->->->. It was the latest she’d slept in years, but of course she hadn’t dropped off until first light, and such sleep as she’d gotten was populated with horrors."
"At <-<-<-<10.15>->->-> Arlena departed from her rondezvous, a minute or two later Patrick Redfern came down and registered surprise, annoyance, etc. Christine's task was easy enough. Keeping her own watch concealed she asked Linda at twenty-five past eleven what time it was. Linda looked at her watch and replied that it was a quarter to twelve."
<-<-<-<10:16>->->-> At last. Forty minutes of hard work and I have made precisely one bed. I'm way behind. But never mind. Just keep moving. Laundry next.
Pacey hummed to himself as he walked slowly toward Abel's office for their daily ten o'clock meeting. It was <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past ten>->->->.
She looked at the corner of the screen. It was only <-<-<-<10.17 am>->->->. She’d been at her desk for forty-seven minutes exactly.
"By the bye, said the first, ""I was able this morning to telegraph the very words of the order to my cousin at <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past ten>->->->.""<br>""And I sent it to the Daily Telegraph at thirteen minutes past ten.""<br>""Bravo, Mr. Blount!""<br>""Very good, M. Jolivet."""
"Wednesday <-<-<-<10:18 A.M.>->->-><br>Kenji Nogami sat upright at his wide oak desk, waiting for the phone to ring. How would Michael play it? Admittedly it was smart to keep everything close to the chest, but still. He would have felt better if Michael Vance, Jr., had favored him with a little more trust."
I know that it was <-<-<-<10:18>->->-> when I got home because I look at my watch a lot.
"Friday <-<-<-<10:19 A.M.>->->-><br>""Altitude seventy-three thousand feet. Airspeed nine thousand knots.”<br>""Petra, raise helmet."" He was slowly regaining his sight as the G-loads began to recede. The cockpit was an oven, overwhelming its environmental control equipment, clear evidence vehicle skin temperature had exceeded design."
"They arrived outside Brides of Bombay at <-<-<-<twenty minutes past ten>->->->. This was never going to be an appointment Seb would be late for. Vijay didn’t comment when Seb asked him to park out of sight, but he was surprised by his next instruction."
"At <-<-<-<10:20>->->-> there was a gentle tap on the door and, like the fairy godmother, Mr. Harrison reappeared.<br>“I hope you both enjoyed a good night’s sleep,” he ventured.<br>“Couldn’t have been better,” said William, after he’d drained his coffee.<br>Not much chance of that when you’re married to a caveman, Beth wanted to tell him, but kept her thoughts to herself."
"A May wind, swelling up like a piece of fruit, with a rough outer skin, slimy flesh, dozens of seeds. The flesh split open in midair, spraying seeds like gentle buckshot into the bare skin of my arms, leaving behind a faint trace of pain.<br>“What time is it?” my cousin asked me. About eight inches shorter than me, he had to look up when he talked.<br>I glanced at my watch. “<-<-<-<Ten twenty>->->->.”"
At about ten o’clock the first tiny snowflakes came loitering down and settled on Jill’s arm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. <-<-<-<In twenty minutes>->->-> the ground was noticeably white.
"<-<-<-<10:21>->->->, and a voice behind her said, “Good morning, Miss Barrington.”"
"Liz Headleand stares into the mirror, as though entranced. She does not see herself or the objects on her dressing-table. The clock abruptly jerks to <-<-<-<10.21>->->->."
Seb looked up at the vast black minute hand on the clock that bounced forward every sixty seconds: <-<-<-<10:22>->->->. Was all the work Cedric had put in going to be for nothing?
"I listened to them, and listened to them again, and then before I had time to figure out what to do, or even what to think or feel, the phone started ringing. It was <-<-<-<10:22>->->->:27. I looked at the caller ID and saw that it was him."
"The date was the 14th of May and the clock on his desk said the time was <-<-<-<twenty three minutes past ten>->->->, so he tapped in the numbers 10.23. At least, that's what he meant to do. In fact he typed in the numbers 10.03"
"Cavalli checked his watch, it was <-<-<-<10:24>->->->, and they’d already been inside the building for seventeen minutes. Although the limousines were waiting, he had no choice but to allow the Conservator to carry on at his own pace."
"Arnet entered the Peabody Wildlife Management Area at <-<-<-<10:24 A.M.>->->->, crested a ridge, and noticed fresh skid marks leading to dark, pool-like stains near the side of the road."
"Dalgliesh reflected that Etienne could hardly have devised a more effective deterrent to visitors and for a moment he wondered whether to walk the half-mile rather than risk his suspension. Glancing at his watch, he saw that it was <-<-<-<10:25>->->->. He would arrive precisely on time."
"As four armed and armored FBI teams surrounded the warehouse at <-<-<-<10:25 AM>->->->, the only person missing was Ned Jennings."
"<-<-<-<10:25>->->->: Phone call from Lüding, very worked up, urging me to return at once and get in touch with Alois, who was equally worked up."
"One meal is enough now, topped up with a glucose shot. Sleep is still 'black', completely unrefreshing. Last night I took a 16 mm. film of the first three hours, screened it this morning at the lab. The first true-horror movie. I looked like a half-animated corpse. Woke <-<-<-<10:25>->->->. To sleep 3:45."
"<-<-<-<10:26>->->-> No. Please, no. I can hardly bear to look. It's a total disaster. Everything in the washing machine has gone pink. Every single thing. What happened? With trembling fingers I pick out a damp cashmere cardigan. It was a cream when I put it in. It's now a sickly shade of candy floss."
"In the exact centre of my visual field was the alarm clock, hands pointing to <-<-<-<ten-twenty-six>->->->. An alarm clock I received as a memento of somebody's wedding."
"Mr. Harcourt woke up with mysterious suddenness at <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past 10>->->->, and, by a curious coincidence, it was at that very instant that the butler came in with two footmen laden with trays of whisky, brandy, syphons, glasses, and biscuits."
She is on holiday in Norfolk. The substandard clock radio says <-<-<-<10:27 a.m.>->->-> The noise is Katrina the Cleaner thumping the hoover against the skirting boards and the bedroom doors. Her hand is asleep. It is still hooked through the handstrap of the camera. She unhooks it and shakes it to get the blood back into it. She puts her feet on top of her trainers and slides them across the substandard carpet. It has the bare naked feet of who knows how many hundreds of dead or old people on it.
"Even when I had to say something, the right words just wouldn’t come out. And every time I hesitated, every time I swallowed back something I was about to say, my cousin looked at me with a slightly confused look on his face. His left ear tilted ever so slightly toward me.<br>“What time is it now?” he asked me.<br>“<-<-<-<Ten twenty nine>->->->,” I replied."
"<-<-<-<Ten-thirty>->->-> the Public Relation comes in with a ladies’ club following him. He claps his fat hands at the day-room door.<br>“Oh, hello, guys; stiff lip, stiff lip ... look around, girls; isn’t it clean, so bright? This is Miss Ratched. I chose this ward because it’s 𝘩𝘦𝘳 ward. She’s, girls, just like a mother. Not that I mean age, but you girls understand ...”"
He checked on Anderson and saw she was still sleeping like a stone. Gardener had decided to wake Bobbi up by <-<-<-<ten-thirty>->->-> if she hadn’t awakened on her own.
"“So be it, then,” replied the count; and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece, he said, “today is the 21st of February”, and drawing out his watch, added, “it is <-<-<-<exactly half past 10 o’clock>->->->. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me on the 21st of May at half past 10 in the forenoon.”"
"At <-<-<-<ten thirty>->->->, Kendra found herself on the couch again, this time with Christy. She felt uncomfortable sitting next to her, especially after the barrage of hate her coworkers had thrown at the blonde, but Christy seemed unusually approachable right then, all smiles and laughs and easy-flowing gestures."
<-<-<-<10.30 a.m.>->->-> Break
"according to the clock on the wall, it is barely <-<-<-<ten thirty>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<ten-thirty>->->-> I'm cleaned up, shaved and dressed in my Easter best - a two-piece seersucker Palm Beach I've had since college."
Inspector Sanderson has told us that he examined the safe at <-<-<-<10.31 a.m.>->->-> and found two good-sized drops of blood on the bottom.
"Date: Sat, 16 May 2009 <-<-<-<10:32 AM>->->-><br>Subject: RE: Meteorite<br>Dear Alex<br>I'm very well (thank you for asking), and I'm delighted to hear you're feeling so much better. With regard to your meteorite, this is an extremely generous offer (and a very welcome one!) but I need to be sure that it's definitely what you want."
"It was <-<-<-<ten thirty-two>->->-> when the bus finally rolled into view.<br>The bus that came was a new type, not like the one I used to take to high school."
"The time checks out. December 12, <-<-<-<10:33 A.M.>->->-> James says the caller disguised their voice. We found a commercial voice changer at the house, in her bedroom."
"<-<-<-<10:34 a.m.>->->-> on 198.088, the lights went out in Labrador, and the backup generators came on, but Labrador's sunline stayed off."
"It was <-<-<-<10:35>->->-> and Brenda Pridmore, at the reception desk at the rear of the main hall of Hoggart's Laboratory, watched wide-eyed while Inspector Blakelock drew toward him the first labeled bag of exhibits from the clunch pit murder."
"Strand post mark and dispatched <-<-<-<ten thirty-six>->->->, said Holmes reading it over and over. ""Mr. Overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it over and somewhat incoherent in consequence."""
"I quite agree with you, said Mr. Murbles. ""It is a most awkward situation. Lady Dormer died at precisely <-<-<-<10.37 a.m.>->->-> on November 11th."""
"<-<-<-<10:38 A.M.>->->-><br>Winston Bartlett was not finding himself entirely satisfied with the way things were going. As he looked her over, he had a lot on his mind. This was the woman who shared his rare blood type and could represent his last hope."
"There must be a solution, there must be. Frantically I scan the cans of products stacked on the shelves. Stain Away. Vanish. There has to be a remedy. ... I just need to think. ... <-<-<-<10:38>->->-> OK, I have the answer. It may not totally work—but it's my best shot."
"“At what time will it be ready?” asked Mr. Codlin faintly.<br>“It’ll be done to a turn,” said the landlord looking up to the clock – and the very clock had a colour in its fat white face, and looked a clock for Jolly Sandboys to consult – “it’ll be done to a turn at <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes before eleven>->->->.”"
"However, I can't allow you to pay for my travel expenses, as we are strangers and nothing may come of our meeting. My flight arrives at <-<-<-<10:39 a.m.>->->->"
"<-<-<-<Ten-forty in the morning>->->-> is hardly an appropriate time to begin imbibing, so I suggest you take it with you. I don't suppose you'll be staying long."
"There, at <-<-<-<10:40>->->->, the plasma engines would ignite at full burn to start the rapid straight-line acceleration that would give them the ten-thousand-kilometers-an-hour speed needed to coast quickly along the Normal-Space tunnel linking the Gates."
"When fifteen minutes have passed and the bogus DPW truck hasn’t returned, Billy decides they have either moved on to another part of the city, maybe to check out the house on Evergreen Street, or have gone back to the McMansion to await further orders from Nick. He closes the curtain, shutting out the view, and looks at his watch. <-<-<-<It’s twenty to eleven>->->->. How time flies when you’re having fun, he thinks."
<-<-<-<10:40>->->->: Call from Katharina asking me whether I had really said what was in the News.
An old man in a condominium apartment facing the sea was looking out his sixth-floor window at the time of the explosion and was able to fix the time of it at precisely <-<-<-<10:41>->->-> Eastern Daylight Time.
"He climbed into the front seat and started the car. It started with a merry powerful hum, ready to go. ""There, the bastards"", said Julian, and smashed the clock with the bottom of the bottle, to give them an approximate time. It was <-<-<-<10:41>->->->."
Ellis scanned the wall-mounted clocks spanning four time zones. The local time read <-<-<-<10:42>->->->. Had word of his gaffe already gone all the way to Trimble?
"24 January, <-<-<-<10.43 a.m>->->->: one month and two days later I wonder if I should worry about the fact that my darling boyfriend bought me a birthday present that has the potential to cause instant death..."
"At the words, “One thousand pounds to the person who unmasks Lady Whistledown,” the clock read <-<-<-<forty-four minutes past ten>->->->."
"Ramona Norville turned out to be a broad-shouldered, heavy-breasted, jovial woman of sixty or so with flushed cheeks, a Marine haircut, and a take-no-prisoners handshake. She was waiting for Tess outside the library, in the middle of the parking space reserved for Today’s Author of Note. Instead of wishing Tess a very good morning (it was <-<-<-<quarter to eleven>->->->), or complimenting her on her earrings (diamond drops, an extravagance reserved for her few dinners out and engagements like this), she asked a man’s question: had Tess come by the 84?"
"If this is so, we have now to determine what Barker and Mrs. Douglas, presuming they are not the actual murderers, would have been doing from <-<-<-<quarter to eleven>->->->, when the sound of the shot brought them down, until quarter past eleven, when they rang for the bell and summoned the servants."
They reached King's Cross at a <-<-<-<quarter to eleven>->->->. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station.
"He reached blindly for his phone and flicked it open. <-<-<-<10:46 am>->->->. Shit. Already late for work and… then, he remembered."
"OLIVE: [At KATHERINE'S elbow—examining her watch on its stand] It's <-<-<-<fourteen minutes to eleven>->->->.<br>KATHERINE: Olive, Olive!<br>OLIVE: I just wanted to see the time."
"<-<-<-<10:47 a.m.>->->-> I'll just send him a tiny friendly message, nothing flirtatious, just to restore good relations."
He whistles in the shower. It is <-<-<-<10.47>->->-> and he is ready for the off.
"I reach for my phone and call Sam. His number is still disconnected. I plug in the USB again, make a fresh attempt at going through his files. My coffee grows cold and my back aches as I stare at the screen. It doesn’t amount to anything. I glanced at the time. <-<-<-<10.47 a.m.>->->->"
"Alex is. Well, Alex is probably losing his mind. It’s <-<-<-<10:48>->->->. He’s pacing. He threw his jacket and tie over the back of the chair as soon as he returned to his room, and he’s got the first two buttons of his dress shirt undone. His hands are twisted up in his hair. This is fine. It’s fine. It’s definitely a terrible idea. But it’s fine."
"At <-<-<-<10.48 am>->->->, I closed my folder but didn't bother putting it back in my bag, so you knew I was on my way to a committee or meeting room nearby. Before I stood up, I folded my paper napkin and put it and the spoon into my coffee cup, a neat sort of person, you thought."
"<-<-<-<10:49 A.M.>->->-><br>As Ally watched Winston Bartlett sweep from the room, she was still trying to take measure of the man. What troubled her was why Grant and Bartlett were both so anxious to get her and her mother out to the clinic."
"By <-<-<-<forty-nine minutes past ten>->->->, we fall in again with a fine portion of the ancient road, which the modern track constantly follows, and descend by some steep windings, hewn in the side of a precipitous cliff, to the place where the Ouad-el-Haoud commences."
"The Rt. Hon. the Lord Barrington of Bristol Docklands was to arrive at St. Paul’s Cathedral at <-<-<-<10:50>->->-> on the morning of April 10th, 1992."

"As he walked back to the flight office, airmen were forming a line to await the arrival of the NAAFI van with morning tea and cakes. Lambert looked at his watch; it was <-<-<-<ten to eleven>->->->."
"but he still remained confident that they could make it to the top when they reached 27,550 feet at <-<-<-<10:51>->->->. That was when he heard a cry that sounded like a wounded animal. He knew it wasn’t Finch."
"‘Anything else?’ he asked, stealing another glance at the clock: <-<-<-<10.51>->->->. Still time to kill.<br>‘I had a word with my parole officer on Monday,’ said Faulkner, ‘and he made no mention of an early release.’"
At <-<-<-<nine minutes to eleven>->->-> on Monday a blond young woman with what amounted to a crew cut came out of Susan's office and took her yellow slicker off the rack and went out of the waiting room without looking at me.
"It was now <-<-<-<eight minutes to eleven>->->->, and he began to feel rather cross and impatient. There was nothing to do in the big, ugly, stately room into which he had been shown."
"At <-<-<-<10:53>->->->, he would be met at the northwest door by the Very Reverend Eric Evans, canon in residence."
"George wanted to say no, but knew he couldn’t. He checked his watch—<-<-<-<10:53>->->->—and nodded. “Good luck,” he said, “but you must turn back by midday at the latest.”"
"He begins to make a record of our observations.""<-<-<-<10.53 hrs>->->->,"" he writes, as we crouch at the top of the stairs, listening to his mother in the hall below."
"I gaze and gaze again at that face, which seems to me both strange and familiar, said Austerlitz, I run the tape back repeatedly, looking at the time indicator in the top left-hand corner of the screen, where the figures covering part of her forehead show the minutes and seconds, from <-<-<-<10:53>->->-> to 10:57, while the hundredths of a second flash by so fast that you cannot read and capture them."
"The buzz of nervous chatter ceased at <-<-<-<six minutes to eleven>->->-> when a tall, elegant man in morning dress entered the room, came to a halt at the foot of the step, and turned to face the assembled gathering."
"<-<-<-<10:54 GMT>->->-><br>""Commander Hawksby's office.""<br>""It's Bruce Lamont, Angela. Can you put me through to the boss?""<br>""He's still in Italy, Bruce. I'm not expecting him back until Monday."""
It was <-<-<-<10:54 A.M.>->->-> Her telephone call would come in a minute. They were at different times each morning and she had a plastic laminated chart that told her what time to expect the call on each day.
"I'm telling you that you paid 6,495 into Bennington's Bank in the High Street at <-<-<-<10:54 a.m.>->->-> today, insisted Frost.<br>""And I'm telling you I did not"" spat the man."

"At <-<-<-<ten fifty-five hours>->->-> sharp Lance Corporal Trumper stood trembling outside the colonel’s tent, almost as fearful of his commanding officer as of going over the top. A few minutes later the company sergeant major marched out of the tent to collect him."
"The call came on his dedicated mobile at <-<-<-<ten-fifty-five>->->->, while he was adding to his selection of organic vegetables, and was Kate's voice. ""We have a case. The apparent murder of a patient at a private clinic in Stoke Cheverell, in Dorset. It's in a manor house."""
"But this meeting, called in Assistant Commissioner Harkness's office on the seventh floor of New Scotland Yard at <-<-<-<ten-fifty-five>->->-> on the morning of Saturday, 23 October, had, from his first entry into the room, the unmistakable presaging of murder."
"At <-<-<-<10:55>->->-> they would enter the Farholme Gate, emerging a mere ten and a half minutes later at Bannermere Gate. Forty light-years away."

"The second hand moved relentlessly—relentlessly towards <-<-<-<10:56>->->->. He busied himself with breakfast and the morning paper. The Post informed him that many buildings had caught fire during the night in one of the worst storms in Washington’s history, and the Lubber Run in Virginia had overflowed its banks, causing heavy property damage."
"Here's your clock, Katy, he said. ""I've got it fixed so that it strikes all right. Only you must be careful not to hit the stiker when you start the pendulum.""<br>""Have you really?"" said Katy.

"Shanghai’s clocks were set an hour ahead so the city could ""save daylight"", but the Bai family said: “We go by the old clock.” Ten o’clock to them was <-<-<-<eleven>->->-> to everyone else.

"It was about <-<-<-<eleven o’clock in the morning>->->->, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars."
"She discovered the necessary servants by breakfasting in bed one morning (still at the hotel), and giving her maid a holiday on condition that the girl “would begin enjoying herself by fetching Miss Clack.” I found her placidly fanning herself in her dressing-gown at <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->->."

"Around <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->-> the door was unlocked. I readied myself to reject apologies and go for the jugular. A once stately woman sailed in. Seventy years old, eighty, eighty-five, who knows when they’re that old? A rickety greyhound in a blazer followed his mistress."

"Around <-<-<-<eleven>->->-> she and Stan have another doughnut. Then they make a hopeful stop at a dumpster out behind a soup joint, but no luck, the stuff has already been picked over."

"He was rather a long time, and I began to feel muffled, weighed down by thick stuffs and silence. I thought: He'll never come back; and when he did his figure seemed to come at me from very far away, dream-like and dwindled, making his way back along a tunnel. I dare say it was champagne <-<-<-<at eleven>->->-> in the morning."
"As they looked the whole world became perfectly silent, and a flight of gulls crossed the sky, first one gull leading, then another, and in this extraordinary silence and peace, in this pallor, in this purity, bells struck <-<-<-<eleven>->->-> times the sound fading up there among the gulls."
"At <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->-> in the morning, large flakes had appeared from a colourless sky and invaded the fields, gardens and lawns of Romerike like an armada from outer space."
"At <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->-> the phone rang, and still the figure did not respond, any more than it had responded when the phone had rung at twenty-five to seven, and again for ten minutes continuously starting at five to seven."
Big Ben was striking as she stepped out into the street. It was <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->-> and the unused hour was fresh as if issued to children on a beach.
"It was about <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->-> in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four millon dollars."
"My sister is terrified that I might write and tell all the family secrets. Why do I feel like a rebel, like an iconoclast? I am only trying to do a writing class, what is wrong with that? I keep telling myself that once in the car I will be fine, I can listen to Radio Four Woman’s Hour and that will take me till <-<-<-<eleven>->->-> o’clock when the class starts."
"ON the morning following the events just narrated, Mrs. Arlington was seated at breakfast in a sweet little parlour of the splendid mansion which the Earl of Warrington had taken and fitted up for her in Dover Street, Piccadilly. It was about <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->->; and the Enchantress was attired in a delicious deshabillé. With her little feet upon an ottoman near the fender, and her fine form reclining in a luxurious large arm-chair, she divided her attention between her chocolate and the columns of the Morning Herald."
"Quiet as I am, I become at <-<-<-<Eleven o'Clock>->->-> in the Morning on every day of the week save Sunday a raving, ranting maniac -- a dangerous lunatic, panting with insane desires to do, not only myself but other people, a mischief, and possessed less by hallucination than by rabies."
"Though perhaps – but here the bracket clock whirred and then hectically struck <-<-<-<eleven>->->->, its weights spooling downwards at the sudden expense of energy. She had to sit for a moment, when the echo had vanished, to repossess her thoughts."
"We got to Waterloo at <-<-<-<eleven>->->->, and asked where the eleven-five started from. Of course nobody knew; nobody at Waterloo ever does know where a train is going to start from, or where a train when it does start is going to, or anything about it."
"We passed a few sad hours until <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->->, when the trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture."
On went the hands of the clock. At one minute to eleven all was peaceful and orderly. At eleven the masters departed for the usual brief interval. At <-<-<-<one minute past eleven>->->-> all was war and tumult!
"O'Neil rises and takes the tray. He has finished the tea, but the muffins are still here in a wicker basket covered with a blue napkin. The clock above the stove says that it is <-<-<-<just past eleven>->->->, and guests will be arriving at the house now."
"It was only <-<-<-<just past eleven>->->->. The stillness of the big room, only broken by the singing that floated up from below, made her yawn. The bronzes, the albums, and the pictures on the walls, representing a ship at sea, cows in a meadow, and views of the Rhine, were so absolutely stale that her eyes simply glided over them without observing them."
"On August 9th, three days later, at <-<-<-<11.02 am>->->->, another B−29 dropped the second bomb on the industrial section of the city of Nagasaki, totally destroying 1 1/2 square miles of the city, killing 39,000 persons and injuring 25,000 more."
"“Yes.” Perena’s firm tone brooked no argument. “It exploded at 11:07. You would have entered at <-<-<-<11:02>->->->, so that by then you would have been exactly midway between the Gates.”"
"What makes you think it's for real?<br>""Just a hunch, really. He sounded for real. Sometimes you can just tell about people""-he smiled-""even if you're a dull old WASP.""<br>""I think it's a setup.""<br>""Why?""<br>""I just do. Why would someone from the government want to help you?""<br>""Good question. Guess I'll find out.""<br>She went back into the kitchen.""What time are you meeting him?"" she called out.<br>""<-<-<-<Eleven oh-three>->->->,"" he said. ""That made me think he's for real. Military and intelligence types set precise appointment times to eliminate confusion and ambiguity. Nothing ambiguous about eleven oh-three."""
"On the fourth, at <-<-<-<11.03 am>->->->, the editor of the Yidische Zaitung put in a call to him; Doctor Yarmolinsky did not answer. He was found in his room, his face already a little dark, nearly nude beneath a large, anachronistic cape."
Senator Harrison died before he reached the hospital and Mark had his wound patched up by a house doctor. Mark checked his watch and laughed. It was <-<-<-<11:04>->->->—he was going to live.
"Consequently we are happy to announce that since the excess excuses have now been used, the <-<-<-<11.04>->->-> DeepDrop to Sydney is ready for boarding at Gate Six."
"As her husband had told him, she was still in bed although it was <-<-<-<past 11 o'clock>->->->. Her normally mobile face was encased in clay, rigid and menacing as an Aztec mask."
<-<-<-<Five past eleven>->->->; less than a quarter of an hour before Amethyst either succeeded or failed
"July 3: 5 3/4 hours. Little done today. Deepening lethargy, dragged myself over to the lab, nearly left the road twice. Concentrated enough to feed the zoo and get the log up to date. Read through the operating manuals Whitby left for the last time, decided on a delivery rate of 40 röntgens/min., target distance of 530 cm. Everything is ready now. Woke <-<-<-<11:05>->->->. To sleep 3:15."
"Sansom arrived in a Town Car at <-<-<-<five past eleven>->->->. Local plates, which meant he had ridden up most of the way on the train. Less convenient for him, but a smaller carbon footprint than driving all the way, or flying. Every detail mattered, in a campaign."
<-<-<-<11:06>->->-> And ... oh. The ironing. What am I going to do about that?
"Despite the remaking of the BookWorld, some books remained tantalisingly out of reach [...] It was entirely possible that they didn't know there was a BookWorld, and still they thought they were real. A fantastic notion, until you consider that up until <-<-<-<11.06 am>->->-> on 12 April 1948, everyone else had thought the same."
"“Yes.” Perena’s firm tone brooked no argument. “It exploded at <-<-<-<11:07>->->->. You would have entered at 11:02, so that by then you would have been exactly midway between the Gates.”"
"At exactly <-<-<-<seven minutes past eleven>->->-> by the ship's clock the Adventurer gave a prolonged screech and, moorings cast off, edged her way out of the basin and dipped her nose in the laughing waters of the bay, embarked at last on a voyage that was destined to fully vindicate her new name."
"Ellis marched back to his desk, battling an onset of panic. In the row of wall clocks, the second hands were relentlessly sprinting as if in a race. Local time was <-<-<-<11:08>->->->.<br>So much for his lunch plans."
He glanced up so that he could see the time on the datastrip along the upper edge of his helmet: <-<-<-<11:08>->->->:23. Ten minutes. They walked unsteadily on.
"“This is my first pass,” Wilson said. “East to west, at <-<-<-<11:08>->->->. We’re looking from the left-wing camera which is running at ninety-six frames per second. As you can see, my altitude is falling rapidly. Straight ahead is the main street of the target.”"
The bursar was standing in the hall with his arms folded across his chest and when he caught sight of the fat young man he looked significantly at the clock. It was <-<-<-<eight minutes past eleven>->->->.
"The last was October 12 at <-<-<-<11:09 a.m.>->->-><br>""It took him all of five weeks,"" I said. ""Except. . ."" The words wouldn't come out. In fact, I was afraid if I opened my mouth I would throw up."
"She backed down the driveway, checked for traffic, and turned toward the turnpike. <-<-<-<Ten past eleven>->->->. Plenty of time.<br>That’s what she thought then."
"<-<-<-<Ten minutes after eleven>->->-> in Archie McCue's room on the third floor of the extension to the Robert Matthews' soaring sixties' tower - The Queen's Tower, although no queen was ever likely to live in it."
"The LCD face on his Super G Digital Athletic Chronometer blinks, <-<-<-<11:11>->->->, on and off and on and off. Eleven eleven. Eleven eleven. Eleven eleven."
"“<-<-<-<11:12>->->-> action stations, action stations.”<br>James slipped quickly into the Lamanns Gallery as Jean-Pierre once again removed from his window the Sutherland watercolor of the Thames and the Boatman, and replaced it with an oil by Van Gogh, as magnificent an example of the master’s work as a London gallery had ever seen."
"<-<-<-<11:12>->->-> I have a solution, via the local paper. A girl from the village will collect it, iron it all overnight at £3 a shirt, and sew on Eddie's button."
"I squinted down the street at the bank clock: <-<-<-<11:12>->->->, 87 degrees.<br>""It's only a block and a half and it's not that hot, Daddy. The walk will do you good."" This conversation made me breathless, as if I were wearing a girdle with tight stays."
His own case was more desperate and required a desperate expedient–to board the <-<-<-<eleven-thirteen>->->-> train without buying a ticket. He went on until he reached the edge of the brewery district where he stopped in a small tobacconist’s to buy pipe tobacco and ask questions.
"The first time I saw them it was <-<-<-<around eleven, eleven-fifteen>->->->, a Saturday morning, I was about two thirds through my route when I turned onto their block and noticed a '56 Ford sedan pulled up in the yard with a big open U-Haul behind."
"The report was dated Sunday, 25 September, 1966, at <-<-<-<11.14 am>->->->. The text was laconic. Call from Hrk Vanger; stating that his brother's daughter (?) Harriett Ulrika Vanger, born 15 June 1960 has been missing from her home on Hedley Island since Saturday afternoon."
"When they’d finished their burgers, Melissa glanced at her watch, a big plastic digital thing that looked like it should belong to a child.<br>“<-<-<-<Eleven fourteen>->->->,” Melissa said. “We’ve still got forty-four minutes to kill before the end of the world.”"
"A stretch of curb in front of Gerard Tower has been stenciled AUTHORIZED PARKING ONLY. At <-<-<-<quarter past eleven>->->-> a truck with a big sombrero on the side pulls up there. Below the sombrero, JOSE’S EATS. And below that, TODOS COMEN! People start leaving the building, trundling toward the truck like ants drawn to sugar."
"The chalet stand isolated at the end of a blind valley. Higher up, there’s only the reservoir, and behind it the treacherous glacier. At <-<-<-<a quarter past eleven>->->->, she concludes that it’s impossible for Nick to be wandering out there, in this weather."
Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the <-<-<-<11:15>->->->.
"Eventually, at <-<-<-<11:16>->->->, he did show up, and took his reserved place at the baccarat table. Stephen stopped sipping his tomato juice and Jean-Pierre moved over and waited patiently by the table for one of the men seated on the left or right of Harvey to leave."
"When Sir Matthew was directly behind his client, he checked his watch. It was <-<-<-<11:17>->->->. He knew his timing had to be exact, because he had become uncomfortably aware that he was dealing not only with a clever woman but also an extremely cunning one."
Ted presented himself at the front door of Number 10 at <-<-<-<11:17>->->-> the next day. The deputy clerk accompanied him down the long corridor to the ground floor and asked him to take a seat in the small waiting area that adjoins the Cabinet Room.
Mrs. Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of George's Church had stopped ringing. It was <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past eleven>->->->: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr. Doran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure she would win.
It is <-<-<-<11.18>->->->. A row of bungalows in a round with a clump of larch tree in the middle.
"A whistle cut sharply across his words. Peter got onto his knees to look out the window, and Miss Fuller glared at him. Polly looked down at her watch: <-<-<-<11:19>->->->. The train. But the stationmaster had said it was always late."
"By <-<-<-<eleven-twenty>->->-> Adam decided he could no longer chance being seen on the road. He stared down the ravine, realizing there was no alternative left open to him now but foot."
"On Friday 17 September at <-<-<-<11.20 am>->->->, my life changed forever. I was standing in the master bedroom of a house in Mosman, staring at the queen-sized bed and deciding whether to dress it in neutral colours or go lavish with a silver-beaded throw, when my mobile phone rang, giving me a start."
OFFICER'S NOTES Disruption alert logged <-<-<-<11h20>->->-> from Stones' Pool Hall (Premises ID 33CBD-Long181). Officer and Aito /379 responded. On arrival found subject shouting threats and acting in aggressive manner. A scan of the subject's SIM ID register revealed that the subject has recent priors including previous public disruptions and a juvenile record.
"Sweeney pointed to the clock above the bar, held in the massive and indifferent jaws of a stuffed alligator head. The time was <-<-<-<11.20>->->->."
"She checked her watch yet again: <-<-<-<eleven twenty-one>->->->. For the first time she began to feel slightly uneasy. Then suddenly she saw him striding across the platform towards her followed by a man dragging two cases, and a porter wheeling even more luggage."
It was <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes past eleven>->->-> by the clock over the elevator doors when Joel Cairo came in from the street. His forehead was bandaged. His clothes had the limp unfreshness of too many hours' consecutive wear.
"Felix Polk of Route 16, Rural Delivery Box 12, appeared here yesterday at approximately <-<-<-<11:22 a.m.>->->->, wanting to know if anybody had shown up with the end of his thumb because he, and I quote, ""Wanted to get it back and have it made into a key chain,"" unquote."
"The music was almost raucous. She turned it off. She lay in silence, waiting for sleep. It was <-<-<-<11:23 a.m.>->->->"
"At <-<-<-<11:24>->->-> we thanked Helen Gillard and asked her to thank the doctor for us, left the house, walked sixty yards to Wolfe's, found the door was bolted, pushed the button and were admitted by Fritz."
"The BEA Viscount landed at Geneva airport at <-<-<-<eleven twenty-five>->->-> local time that morning, a few minutes later than scheduled. The stewardess advised passengers to put their watches forward one hour to Central European Time."
"At 10.15 Arlena departed from her rondezvous, a minute or two later Patrick Redfern came down and registered surprise, annoyance, etc. Christine's task was easy enough. Keeping her own watch concealed, she asked Linda at <-<-<-<twenty-five past eleven>->->-> what time it was. Linda looked at her watch and replied that it was a quarter to twelve."
"When, at about <-<-<-<11.25 am>->->->, Katharina Blum was finally taken from her apartment for questioning, it was decided not to handcuff her at all."
"A pair of brown shoes appeared beneath his urine bag. ""I counted eleven bells.""<br>""The current time is <-<-<-<11:26 AM>->->->.""<br>""What day?""<br>""Your injury occurred yesterday."""
"At <-<-<-<11:26 a.m.>->->->, 0xAA289 experienced an unconnected hardware failure in one of the nodes it was running on."
"Tom turned into Savoy Place at <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past eleven>->->->, to face a fleet of stationary limousines disgorging their passengers outside the hotel."
It's from one of the more recent plates the tree has scanned: <-<-<-<11.27>->->-> in the morning of 4 April 1175
"From twenty minutes past nine until twenty-seven minutes past nine, from twenty-five minutes past eleven until <-<-<-<twenty-eight minutes past eleven>->->->, from ten minutes to three until two minutes to three the heroes of the school met in a large familiarity whose Olympian laughter awed the fearful small boy that flitted uneasily past and chilled the slouching senior that rashly paused to examine the notices in assertion of an unearned right."
"He looked up at the foyer clock: <-<-<-<11:29>->->->. He walked quickly across to the lifts, checked his tie in the mirror and took a deep breath. The clock struck twice, the lift doors opened and out stepped Mr. Morita and his two colleagues."
"You are four minutes too slow. No matter; it's enough to mention the error. Now from this moment, <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m.>->->->, this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service."
"It was still a <-<-<-<minute short of 11:30>->->->. He would make time to visit the monuments in St. George's church in Bradwell, but after that brief visit there would be no possible excuse for not driving back to London to lunch at New Scotland Yard."
"The boys' loud laughter turned into groans, however, when he coldly informed them they would have school all afternoon that day instead of the usual 8:00 to <-<-<-<11:30>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<11:30 A.M.>->->->, Charlie ran out the school’s front door, jumped, and cleared all six concrete steps. He tore down the walk as fast as he could, his Red-Ball Jets slapping the pavement all the way to the street."
It was Tuesday-my half day-and at <-<-<-<11:30 a.m.>->->-> a call came in. An eversion of the uterus in a cow. This is the tough job in the country practice and I felt the usual chill.
"Five minutes later another truck pulls up behind the first. On the side of this one is a grinning cartoon boy woofing down a double cheeseburger. At <-<-<-<eleven-thirty>->->->, while people are lined up for burgers and fries and tacos and enchiladas, a hotdog wagon appears."
"I woke up in a panic, not screaming, just a groan from deep in my throat. I’d dozed off in the hard plastic chair by the window. The clock above the door showed <-<-<-<11:30>->->-> and the ICU was dead silent. Adrenaline supply not yet depleted, I staggered to my feet."
"And so it was that around <-<-<-<half past eleven>->->->, I found myself riding down to the Village on the Fifth Avenue bus with the street address of Hobart and Blackwell in my pocket, written on a page from one of the monogrammed notepads Mrs Barbour kept by the telephone."
"“The extraordinary thing is,” he told Livia at <-<-<-<eleven-thirty>->->->, “you seem to be the only applicant. Or at least, the only one who’s showed up.”"
"It is now <-<-<-<11.30>->->->. The door to this room is shut, and will remain shut, barring emergencies, until 12.00. I am authorised to inform you that we are now under battle orders."
"O, Frank - I made a mistake! - I thought that church with the spire was All Saints', and I was at the door at <-<-<-<half-past eleven>->->-> to a minute as you said."
"Thank-you, said C.B. quietly; but as he hung up his face was grim. In a few minutes he would have to break it to John that, although they had braved such dreadful perils dring the earlier part of the night they had, after all, failed to save Christina. Beddows had abjured Satan at a little after <-<-<-<half-past eleven>->->->. By about eighteen minutes the Canon had beaten them to it again."
This time it was Kumiko. The wall clock said <-<-<-<11.30>->->->.
"About <-<-<-<11:30>->->-> this morning I asked her if she was going to fix anything for Thanksgiving, and she looked at me like she didn't even know what I was talking about."
"Albatross 8 passed over Pamlico Sound at <-<-<-<1131>->->-> local time. Its on-board programming was designed to trace thermal receptors over the entire visible horizon, interrogating everything in sight and locking on any signature that fit its acquisition parameters."
"And after that, not forgetting, there was the Flemish armada, all scattered, and all officially drowned, there and then, on a lovely morning, after the universal flood, at about <-<-<-<eleven thirty two>->->-> was it? Off the coast of Cominghome."
"At <-<-<-<11:33>->->-> the sleek cream nose of an Aston Martin slid to a stop at the gate and Maurice Kemp-Lore stepped out. He stretched himself, stiff from driving, and glanced over the front of the cottage."
"The private detective joined him at <-<-<-<11:34 a.m.>->->->, only minutes after the Paddington express had pulled into Temple Meads station. Mitchell slipped into the chair opposite his only client, although he hadn’t received any remuneration for several months."
"Christmas Eve 1995. <-<-<-<11.34 am>->->->. The first time, Almasa says it slowly and softly, as if she is really looking for an answer, ""Are you talking to me?"" She peers into the small, grimy mirror in a train toilet."
"This was exactly the kind of case I’d been hoping for. I went through the motions of checking my schedule, though, and pretended to be shuffling a few things around. If you instantly agree to take a case, the client might suspect some ulterior motive.<br>“Luckily I’m free until later this afternoon,” I said, shooting my watch a glance. It was <-<-<-<eleven thirty-five>->->->. “If you don’t mind, could you take me over to your building now? I’d like to see the last place you saw your husband.”"
"The Prime Minister’s plane came to a stop at Oberweisenfeld airport at <-<-<-<11.35 a.m.>->->-> The engines whined and died. Inside the cabin, after three hours of flight the silence was a noise in itself."
"At <-<-<-<11.35>->->-> the Colonel came out; he looked hot and angry as he strode towards the lift. There goes a hanging judge, thought Wormold."
"Velma Pitt-Cowley, Mrs. Carling's literary agent, had agreed to be at the flat at <-<-<-<11:30 and arrived six minutes late>->->->. She was hardly inside the door before it became apparent that she was in none too good a temper."
"I ran up the stairs, away from the heat and the noise, the mess and the confusion. I saw the clock radio by my bed. <-<-<-<Eleven thirty-six>->->->."
At <-<-<-<eleven thirty-seven>->->-> I handed over the full and final settlement to Mr. Fothergill in exchange for the freehold of Number 1 Chelsea Terrace.
"Took a call at <-<-<-<11:37 a.m.>->->-> from a woman who identified herself as Jean Garfield, secretary to Pan-Con Certification Examiner Jim Long of Dallas. Asked how to go about lodging a complaint of religious harassment against Rayford Steele due to his pressuring Long during his recert this a.m."
"He glanced at his watch: <-<-<-<11:38>->->->. He put down his drink, and ran out of the apartment."
"At <-<-<-<11:38>->->->, she left her desk and walked to the side door of the auditorium, arriving ten minutes before noon."
"Time? Raith asked.<br>""<-<-<-<Eleven-thirty-nine>->->->, my lord,"" the bodyguard reported.<br>""Ah, good. Still time."" He walked over to a group of pillows in the far corner of the room, and I realized that they had been strewn around a little raised platform of stone."
"After painstaking ticket-office conversations and timetable consultations, I established with as much certainty as any tourist can hope for that the <-<-<-<11.39>->->-> to Paris Est was a service on which accompanied bicycles could be carried free of charge."
"There was a group of about twenty people waiting for the <-<-<-<11:40>->->-> train, and the murderess and her daughter walked some fifty yards farther down the platform and stood alone, not speaking."
"But the door was locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods. He sat down again, and drew his journal from his pocket. On the line where these words were written, ""21st December, Saturday, Liverpool,"" he added, ""80th day, <-<-<-<11.40 am>->->->,"" and waited."
"During the sessions at Ito he read the Lotus Sutra on mornings of play, and he now seemed to be bringing himself to order through silent meditation. Then, quickly, there came a rap of stone on board. It was <-<-<-<twenty minutes before noon>->->->."
Giles turned to see the dean standing by his side. He bowed. It must be <-<-<-<11:41>->->->.
"Once he was back behind the wheel, he checked his watch: <-<-<-<11:41>->->->. No reason he shouldn’t make it to Shillingford in a couple of hours, although he knew his father would be pacing up and down the driveway long before then."
"Spagnola took a deep breath and started into the log again. ""<-<-<-<Eleven forty-one>->->->: large dog craps in Dr. Yamata's Aston Martin. Twelve oh-three: dog eats two, count 'em, two of Mrs. Wittingham's Siamese cats. She just lost her husband last week; this sort of put her over the edge. We had to call Dr. Yamata in off the putting green to give her a sedative."""
The front door opens. Her heart pounds. She looks at the time on the bottom right of her screen. <-<-<-<11.42>->->->.
"<-<-<-<11:42>->->-> I'm doing fine. I'm doing well. I've got the Hoover on, I'm cruising along nicely- What was that? What just went up the Hoover? Why is it making that grinding noise? Have I broken it?"
"<-<-<-<Eleven-forty-three>->->->. In four minutes, give or take, Emma would die."
"If not for the cloud cover, a spotter in a low-flying plane might have been able to see all three at the same time, the Subaru and both Humvees, at <-<-<-<11:43>->->-> EST, when the President finished his speech by saying, ""God bless you, my fellow Americans, and God bless America."""
"Weiss's watch said <-<-<-<sixteen minutes to twelve>->->->, and the detonation was set for noon, as set by a bank of electric clocks and three seperate control cables. But when the dragon embraced the bomb and tightened his grip, it was enough."
It was <-<-<-<eleven forty-five>->->-> but my cousin still wasn’t back. It was getting close to lunchtime and the cafeteria was starting to get more crowded. All sorts of sounds and voices mixed together like smoke enveloping the room. I returned once more to the realm of memory. And that small gold pen she had in her breast pocket.
<-<-<-<11:45 AM>->->-> - 06/05/2014<br>More details have emerged in the investigation into the killings at Val-de-Grâce early Wednesday morning.
"I waited till a <-<-<-<quarter to twelve>->->->, and found then that I was in All Souls'. But I wasn't much frightened, for I thought it could be tomorrow as well."
"I will tell you the time, said Septimus, very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously. As he sat smiling at the dead man in the grey suit the quarter struck, the <-<-<-<quarter to twelve>->->->."
"I arrived at St. Gatien from Nice on Tuesday, the 14th of August. I was arrested at <-<-<-<11.45 am>->->-> on Thursday, the 16th by an agent de police and an inspector in plain clothes and taken to the Commissariat."
"Because the two curses that have struck here in Chicago arrived at <-<-<-<eleven forty-seven>->->-> in the morning, and damned close to that last night. Add two hours to the deaths in California to account for the difference in time zones. The curse was sent at the same time. Thirteen minutes before noon or midnight."
"It was a vast plain with no one on it, neither living on the earth nor dead beneath it; and I walked a long time beneath a colourless sky, which didn't let me judge the time (my watch, set like all military watches to Berlin time, hadn't stood up to the swim and showed an eternal <-<-<-<thirteen minutes to noon>->->->)."
"Well, you better go back with me. They'll be mighty glad to see you.<br>""We can make that <-<-<-<eleven-forty-eight>->->-> if we hurry,"" he said. ""I'll have to change a few things."""
"Richie hadn't made any outgoing calls after <-<-<-<11:49 A.M.>->->-> However, there was a long list of incoming calls that afternoon, calls he would never return."
"At 11:38, she left her desk and walked to the side door of the auditorium, arriving <-<-<-<ten minutes before noon>->->->."
The man who gave them to him handed him a ten-shilling note and promised him another if it were delivered at exactly <-<-<-<ten minutes to twelve>->->->.
"The next day, at <-<-<-<nine minutes to twelve>->->-> o'clock noon, the last clock ran down and stopped. It was then placed in the town museum, as a collector's item, or museum piece, with proper ceremonies, addresses, and the like."
"He walked back to Delaney Street at <-<-<-<eight minutes to twelve>->->-> and pretended to browse the bookshop. At twelve o'clock Monty called to his neighbor and, a second or two later, appeared from the back of the shop wearing his denim jacket and went across to the Blind Beggar."
"Every day Patti Goss-Simpson brings four fish sticks to school and her Titan Deep Freeze lunchbox and every day at <-<-<-<11:52 a.m.>->->->, because the cafeteria is being remodeled, Patti puts her terrible fish sticks in the terrible microwave at the back of Mr. Bates' room and presses the terrible beepy buttons and the smell that pours out feels to Seymour like he’s being pressed face-first into a swamp."
"At any rate, we whirled into the station with many more, just as the great clock pointed to <-<-<-<eight minutes to twelve>->->-> o'clock. ""Thank God! We are in time,"" said the young man, ""and thank you, too, my friend, and your good horse."""
"Afterward it was recalled by observing citizens that just before noon - <-<-<-<seven minutes to twelve>->->->, in fact - a small cloud no bigger than the proverbial hand crossed the sun hurriedly as if afraid to tarry."
He swilled off the remains of [his beer] and looked at the clock. It was <-<-<-<six minutes to twelve>->->->.
"“‘Han will have that shield down,’ ” Aech quoted. “‘We’ve got to give him more time!’”<br>I laughed, then used my robot’s right hand to tap the back of its left wrist, indicating the time. “Aech is right. It’s still <-<-<-<six minutes to noon>->->->.”"
"The prisoners would be allowed out of their cells to watch the World Cup match between England and Argentina. At <-<-<-<five minutes to twelve>->->->, the doors were unlocked and the prisoners flooded out of their cells, all heading in one direction."

"What time did you arrive at the site?<br>""It was <-<-<-<11:55>->->->. I remember since I happened to glance at my watch when we got there. We rode our bicycles to the bottom of the hill, as far as we could go, then climbed the rest of the way on foot."""
Aaron checked his watch on the run: <-<-<-<four minutes to twelve>->->->. He prayed that Harry would be late. Harry was never late.

"By the time that it only wanted <-<-<-<three minutes to noon>->->->, the droll object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great rate, so that every body soon had a good look at him."
"A few minutes' light <-<-<-<around noon>->->-> is all that you need to discover the error, and re-set the clock – provide that you bother to go up and make the observation."
"I wondered what the time is? said the latter after a pause.<br>""I don't know exactly"", replied Easton, ""but it <-<-<-<can't be far-off twelve>->->->."""
"Danny turned to the business section of The Times to check on his investments while he waited for the innocent Mr. Hall to appear. At <-<-<-<two minutes to twelve>->->->, Mario was standing by his side. “Sir Nicholas, your guest has arrived.”"
"Nguyen shrugged. He pointed at the clock on the dashboard that said <-<-<-<11:58 AM>->->->. ""Maybe they're heading to lunch."" He smiled, as he returned his focus to the road and the vehicles in front of him.<br>Noack mumbled, ""If only."""

"<-<-<-<Two minutes before the clock struck noon>->->->, the savage baron was on the platform to inspect the preparation for the frightful ceremony of mid-day. The block was laid forth-the hideous minister of vengeance, masked and in black, with the flaming glaive in his hand, was ready. The baron tried the edge of the blade with his finger, and asked the dreadful swordsman if his hand was sure? A nod was the reply of the man of blood."
"Terry looked at the old man anxiously. “You haven’t signed any papers, have you, Mr. Langley?” She looked at her watch. “It’s just <-<-<-<one minute before twelve>->->->. I still have time to take up that option. Here’s your check!”"
"There is a big grandfather clock there, and as the hands drew <-<-<-<near to twelve>->->-> I don't mind confessing I was as nervous as a cat."
"The day after that again, <-<-<-<about noon>->->->, a decurion with his command of ten horsemen approached Nazareth from the south—that is, from the direction of Jerusalem. The place was then a straggling village, perched on a hill-side, and so insignificant that its one street was little more than a path well beaten by the coming and going of flocks and herds."
"Towards <-<-<-<noon>->->-> he rose and began to write a letter to her; but he could not find the right words, and after many times laying his brush aside he determined at last to send her some nice pictures instead."
"And there, almost at its foot, so close that the shadow of the palace tower fell upon it in the <-<-<-<noonday>->->-> sun, was his own house, sandwiched between the walls, with its small courtyard, two low doors, and the little pool of water."
"At <-<-<-<noon>->->-> that day the galley was skimming the sea off Paestum. The wind was yet from the west, filling the sail to the master’s content. The watches had been established. On the foredeck the altar had been set and sprinkled with salt and barley, and before it the tribune had offered solemn prayers to Jove and to Neptune and all the Oceanidae, and, with vows, poured the wine and burned the incense."
"An hour passed, and though Pilate deigned them no answer, the rabbis and crowd remained. <-<-<-<Noon>->->-> came, bringing a shower from the west, but no change in the situation, except that the multitude was larger and much noisier, and the feeling more decidedly angry."
"Exactly at <-<-<-<noon>->->-> the dromedary, of its own will, stopped, and uttered the cry or moan, peculiarly piteous, by which its kind always protest against an overload, and sometimes crave attention and rest. The master thereupon bestirred himself, waking, as it were, from sleep."
"It was about <-<-<-<noon>->->-> today when Jim Pietre called the office on the phone.<br>""Now, look, Pete,"" he started out. ""What kind of gag are you pulling?""<br>I chortled to myself and pulled the dead pan on him.<br>""What do you mean, boy?"" I asked back into the phone. ""Gag? What kind of gag? What are you talking about?""<br>""A coin. A coin."" He was impatient. ""You remember you sent me a coin in the mail?"""

"When Sister Anna brought him back to Patmos at <-<-<-<noon>->->->, Gunther shouted to anyone and everyone within earshot, ""I can read! I can read!"""
"You, Willi, my friend, said Pastor Fritz softly, ""you who sit in midnight darkness at <-<-<-<midday>->->->, is this Jesus Christ a horn of salvation, a light in your darkness?"""
"They were now on their way back toward the city that was flooded with <-<-<-<midday>->->-> sunlight. The sunlight was dense across the plain, and the mountains by Stjärnor disappeared in a blueish gray haze."
"Fine dust in my mouth and nose, sifting through my cotton bandana. Grit in the corners of my eyes, in my ears, all through my hair. When we stopped for a <-<-<-<noon>->->-> meal, I felt as if my own flesh might change back into the dust that coated me."
"Jubilee asked, ""Won't you join us for lunch, Christopher?""<br>""I would like that, but I'm afraid I'm on guard duty at the jail come <-<-<-<noon>->->->. I'd best be going."""
"It was <-<-<-<noon>->->-> and the light came in bursts through the choir windows, and even more through those of the facade, creating white cascades that, like mystic streams of divine substance, intersected at various points of the church, engulfing the altar itself."
"At <-<-<-<twelve o'clock>->->-> the bus came, and Torvik stood at the post office to meet it. Pastor Bengtsson alighted. He was a short, stocky man, with alert black eyes and rather thick rustic lips."
At <-<-<-<twelve o'clock>->->-> the bus would be leaving with the morning mail. It was the last opportunity for the day to post the letter. He really ought not wait any longer with the application. But did he really dare take this step before he was sure of God's will? He prayed afresh.
"Holly tries to ignore the headache her mother’s calls — and this call in particular — almost always bring on. She assures her mother that yes, she will be there on Sunday to help, and yes, she will be there by <-<-<-<noon>->->->, so they can eat one more meal as a family."
"Then my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist at this big hospital. I had an appointment for <-<-<-<twelve o’clock>->->->, and I was in an awful state."
"When she woke up it was <-<-<-<noon>->->->, and someone was pounding on the door. Probably it was West, come back because he’d forgotten something. (His underwear was gone from the drawer, his neatly arranged socks, washed by Tony and folded carefully in pairs. He’d taken a suitcase.)"
"A tub was brought in to melt snow for mortar. They heard somebody saying it was <-<-<-<twelve o’clock>->->-> already.<br>“It’s sure to be twelve,” Shukhov announced. “The sun’s over the top already.”<br>“If it is,” the captain retorted, “it’s one o’clock, not twelve.”<br>“How do you make that out?” Shukhov asked in surprise. “The old folk say the sun is highest at dinnertime.”<br>“Maybe it was in their day!” the captain snapped back. “Since then it’s been decreed that the sun is highest at one o’clock.”<br>“Who decreed that?”<br>“The Soviet government.”"
"“Do you you include violin playing in your category of rows?” he asked, anxiously.<br>“It depends on the player,” I answered, “A well-played violin is a treat for the gods - a badly played one --”<br>“Oh, that’s all right, he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may consider the thing as settled — that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.”<br>“When shall we see them?”<br>“Call for me at <-<-<-<noon>->->-> to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle everything,” he answered.<br>“All right — noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand."
"Prowling around aimlessly. A beautiful day—so far. The Rue de Buci is alive, crawling. The bars wide open and the curbs lined with bicycles. All the meat and vegetable markets are in full swing. Arms loaded with truck bandaged in newspapers. A fine Catholic Sunday—in the morning, at least.<br><-<-<-<High noon>->->-> and here I am standing on an empty belly at the confluence of all these crooked lanes that reek with the odor of food."
"“What’s the time?” he said to the clock. It dipped its head, sproinged upright again.<br>“It’s <-<-<-<noon>->->->. It’s noon, it’s noon, it’s . . .”<br>“Shut up,” said Jimmy. The clock wilted. It was programmed to respond to harsh tones."
"“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”<br>“By no means.”<br>“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”<br>“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the <-<-<-<twelve o’clock>->->-> train, so as to be there in time for your coming.”"
"I am writing this at <-<-<-<noon>->->->. Ben is downstairs, reading. He thinks I am resting but, even though I am tired, I am not. I don’t have time. I have to write this down before I lose it. I have to write my journal."
"I did Danièle’s math in my head. “If we start at ten, walk for four hours, rest for one, walk for another two, that’s seven hours in total. That will take us to five in the morning. Seven hours back, it won’t be <-<-<-<noon>->->-> until we resurface.”"

"At <-<-<-<noon>->->-> each day every last one of them, from Don Bernardo the priest to the widow Esmerelda, the village prostitute, stopped work and strolled over to the Pertinis’ vine-shaded terrace, where for two hours they ate like royalty and drank wine made from the same grapes which ripened above their heads."
"There's nobody here! I insisted. ""It was yourself, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while since.""<br>""Myself!"" she gasped, ""and the clock is striking <-<-<-<twelve>->->->!"""
"A cheap little clock on the wall struck <-<-<-<twelve>->->-> hurriedly, and served to begin the conversation."
"He had saved [the republic] and it was now in the present, alive now and everywhere in the present, and the hovering faces brightened and blurred about him, became the sound of a canal in the morning, the look of some roofs in the <-<-<-<noon>->->-> sun, and the fragrance of a certain evening flower. Here he was, home at last. Behind him were the mountains and the Sleeping Woman in the sky, and before him, like smoky flames in the sunset, the whole beautiful beloved city."
"It was precisely <-<-<-<twelve o’clock>->->->; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke, and died up there among the seagulls."
"<-<-<-<Noon>->->-> found him momentarily alone, while the family prepared lunch in the kitchen. The cracks in the ceiling widened into gaps. The locked wheels of his bed sank into new fault lines opening in the oak floor beneath the rug. At any moment the floor was going to give."
"On Friday <-<-<-<noon>->->->, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travellers into the gulf below."
Roaring <-<-<-<noon>->->->. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch.

"Then came the stroke of <-<-<-<noon>->->->, and all these working and professional people dispersed like a trampled anthill into all the streets and directions. The white bridge was swarming with nimble dots. And when you considered that each dot had a mouth with which it was now planning to eat lunch, you couldn't help bursting into laughter."
"One day, about the hour of <-<-<-<noon>->->->, a little more than a week after my first experiment, I rolled twenty grains of hashish into a pill and swallowed it, saying as I did so, “Here is the final test for the sake of science.”"
“Madam President …” Florentyna had to think quickly to prevent anyone noticing her instinctive response to the words. “It’s <-<-<-<one minute past midday>->->->.”
"At <-<-<-<one minute past twelve>->->->, Percy stood to attention, slowly raised the Union Jack up the flagpole and delivered the exact words required by the Territories Settlement Act of 1762: “I claim this sovereign territory in the name of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, to whom I swear my allegiance.”"
"It was the twelfth of December, the twelfth month. A was twelve. The electric clock/radio by his bedside table said <-<-<-<12:01>->->->."
At <-<-<-<two minutes past twelve>->->-> the door opens and two men come into the lobby. One is tall with black hair combed in a 50’s pompadour. The other is short and bespectacled. Both are wearing suits.
"It had struck <-<-<-<twelve o'clock two minutes and a quarter>->->->. The Baron's footman hastily seized a large goblet, and gasped with terror as he filled it with hot, spiced wine.<br>""Tis past the hour, 'tis past,"" he groaned in anguish, ""and surely I shall now get the red hot poker the Baron hath so often promised me, oh! Woe is me! Would that I had prepared the Baron's lunch before!"""
"It was now <-<-<-<three minutes after midday>->->->. The blinds had been earlier drawn down, seeming to disconnect time as well as shutting out the surly half-light of late morning."
"At <-<-<-<12.03>->->-> the sun has already punched its ticket. Sinking, it stains the cobbles and stucco of the platz in a violin-coloured throb of light that you would have to be a stone not to find poignant."
"When it’s <-<-<-<12:04>->->-> it can be lunch so I cut a can of baked beans open, I’m careful. I wonder would Ma wake up if I cutted my hand and screamed help?"
I wake up the next day seized by panic. I bolt out of bed and stumble into the kitchen where I look at the clock on the microwave: <-<-<-<12:04 P.M.>->->->
"At <-<-<-<four minutes past twelve>->->->, Frank Macintosh and Paulie Logan enter the lobby dressed in their suits. There are handshakes all around. Frank’s pompadour appears to have had an oil change."
"Though by then it was by Tina's own desk clock <-<-<-<12.04 pm>->->-> I was always touched when, out of a morning's worth of repetition, secretaries continued to answer with good mornings for an hour or so into the afternoon, just as people often date things with the previous year well into February; sometimes they caught their mistake and went into a ""This is not my day"" or ""Where is my head?"" escape routine; but in a way they were right, since the true tone of afternoons does not take over in offices until nearly two."
I could not have committed this crime. Pauline Stacy fell from this floor to the ground at <-<-<-<five minutes past twelve>->->->. A hundred people will go into the witness-box and say that I was standing out upon the balcony of my own rooms above from just before the stroke of noon to a quarter-past - the usual period of my public prayers.

"I stashed my basket of dirty rags and Turtle Wax by the exit door in the arcade. It was <-<-<-<ten past noon>->->->, but right then food wasn’t what I was hungry for. I walked slowly along the track and into Horror House."

"They paid for only one room and kept Einstein with them because they were not going to need privacy for lovemaking. Exhausted, Travis barely managed to kiss Nora before falling into a deep sleep. He dreamed of things with yellow eyes, misshapen heads, and crocodile mouths full of sharks’ teeth. He woke five hours later, at <-<-<-<twelve-ten>->->-> Thursday afternoon."
"She was to leave the reception as soon as she could and return to her room to change clothes. At <-<-<-<12:11>->->-> there'd be another blackout, during which she'd take the outside stairwell to the ground floor and wait at the exit for a Broadmoor's catering van."
"At <-<-<-<12:11>->->-> there was a knock on the door. It was Terry, A could tell. He hadn't known Terry long, but there was something calmer, more patient, that separated Terry's knocks from the rest of the staff. He knocked from genuine politeness, not formality.<br>""Come in,"" A said, although the lock was on the other side. Terry did.<br>""It's your mother,"" he said. ""There's no easy way to say this."" Though he had just used the easiest, because A now knew the rest. A’s face froze, as it tried to catch up, as it tried to register the news. Then it crumpled, and while he considered this fresh blow, the tears came."
Were you on Carlin Street at approximately <-<-<-<12:12>->->-> when Carietta White came out of the First Congregational Church on that street?
"It was the twelfth of December, the twelfth month. A was twelve. The electric clock/radio by his bedside table said 12:01. A was waiting for it to read <-<-<-<12:12>->->->, he hoped there would be some sense of cosmic rightness when it did."
"It’s <-<-<-<12:13>->->->, so it can be lunch. My favorite bit of the prayer is the daily bread. I’m the boss of play, but Ma’s the boss of meals, like she doesn’t let us have cereal for breakfast and lunch and dinner in case we’d get sick and anyway that would use it up too fast."
"She left London on the <-<-<-<twelve-fourteen>->->-> from Paddington, arriving at Bristol (where she had to change) at two-fifty."

"At <-<-<-<twenty minutes after twelve>->->-> he got up, resolutely sealed the large brown envelope, put on his raincoat, and walked down to the village. He dug his hands into his pockets and took longer steps."
"“But by the time he reached the top of the hill the woman’s body had basically been eaten up already by the flies, right?” my friend said.<br>“In a sense,” his girlfriend replied.<br>“In a sense being eaten by the flies makes it a sad story, doesn’t it?” my friend said.<br>“Yes, I guess so,” she said after giving it some thought. “What do you think?” she asked me.<br>“Sounds like a sad story to me,” I replied.<br>It was <-<-<-<twelve twenty>->->-> when my cousin came back."

"After a moment reality reasserted itself, and she realized she hadn't been hallucinating, but dreaming. The clock on the desk read 12:55. They'd begun their ten-minute session at <-<-<-<12:25>->->->, so obviously she had twenty minutes to account for."

<-<-<-<12.30 p.m.>->->-> Lunch
"At <-<-<-<half past twelve>->->->, when Catherine’s anxious attention to the weather was over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment, the sky began voluntarily to clear. A gleam of sunshine took her quite by surprise; she looked round; the clouds were parting, and she instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance. Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed, and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had “always thought it would clear up.”"
"Tuesday, <-<-<-<12.30 pm>->->->… Baker, California… Into the Ballantine Ale now, zombie drunk and nervous. I recognize this feeling: three or four days of booze, drugs, sun, no sleep and burned out adrenalin reserves – a giddy, quavering sort of high that means the crash is coming. But when? How much longer?"

"<-<-<-<12:34 P.M.>->->-><br>""W.B., we've got a problem,"" Karl Van de Vliet said into the microphone. He was in his private office, on the scrambled videophone. ""Kristen's mother showed up just before noon with a pistol, demanding to know where she was."""

"As surely as Apthorpe was marked for early promotion, Trimmer was marked for ignominy. That morning he had appeared at the precise time stated in orders.

"<-<-<-<12:36 CET>->->-><br>Once the ship had docked, William and Monti leaned over the railing and watched as Grant lugged the casket down the gangway. He was still clutching it as he climbed into the back seat of a waiting car."

"It was <-<-<-<12:37>->->-> when Jason, in blue jeans, cap and dark, tattered V-necked sweater, reached the gates of the old factory. He took out a pack of Gauloise cigarettes and leaned against the wall, lighting one with a match, holding the flame longer than necessary before he blew it out."
"At what time did the 12:23 p.m. S-line bus proceeding in the direction of Porte de Champerret arrive on that day?<br>""At <-<-<-<12:38 p.m.>->->->""<br>""Were there many people on the aforesaid S-bus?""<br>""Bags of 'em.""<br>""Did you particularly notice any of them?""<br>""An individual who had a very a long neck and a plait round his hat."""

It was <-<-<-<eighteen minutes to one>->->->. She went to the house phone and called his room. The telephone rang and rang, but there was no answer."
"Died five minutes ago, you say? he asked. His eye went to the watch on his wrist. <-<-<-<Twelve-forty-three>->->->, he wrote on the blotter."

"Because it was raining, and because she was depressed and out of sorts, and because Robbie had not come by <-<-<-<quarter to one>->->->, Elizabeth treated herself to a Martini while she was waiting, sitting uncomfortably on a narrow chair in the restaurant, watching other unimpressive people go in and out."

"The first victim of the Krefeld raid died at <-<-<-<12:49 hours>->->-> Double British Summer Time at B Flight, but it wasn't due to carelessness."

"“There are two flights out of Bombay today, both of them Air India.” She glanced down at her pad. “One in forty minutes’ time, at <-<-<-<12:50>->->->, so you couldn’t possibly make it to the airport in time, and one-“"
"<-<-<-<Ten minutes to one>->->-> the fog dissolves completely and the black boys are telling Acutes to clear the floor for the meeting. All the tables are carried out of the day room to the tub room across the hall—leaves the floor, McMurphy says, like we was aiming to have us a little dance."

"I listen to the different boats' horns, hoping to learn what kind of boat I'm hearing and what the signal means: is the boat leaving or entering the harbor; is it the ferry, or a whale-watching boat, or a fishing boat? At 5:33 pm there is a blast of two deep, resonant notes a major third apart. On another day there is the same blast at <-<-<-<12:54 pm>->->->. On another, exactly 8:00 am."
"At home, the kitchen clock was ticking loudly. She unpacked the globe and checked the time. The house felt so quiet and empty without Benny. The clock said <-<-<-<five minutes to one>->->->.

"At <-<-<-<five minutes to one>->->->, the host of the show emerged from a heated tent to massive applause from the crowd. She was dressed in a fuchsia coat, with a black turtleneck, a knee-length skirt, black tights, and knee-high boots."

"A tub was brought in to melt snow for mortar. They heard somebody saying it was twelve o’clock already.<br>“It’s sure to be twelve,” Shukhov announced. “The sun’s over the top already.”<br>“If it is,” the captain retorted, “it’s <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->->, not twelve.”<br>“How do you make that out?” Shukhov asked in surprise. “The old folk say the sun is highest at dinnertime.”<br>“Maybe it was in their day!” the captain snapped back. “Since then it’s been decreed that the sun is highest at one o’clock.”<br>“Who decreed that?”<br>“The Soviet government.”"
"It was <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->-> when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade"
"He bought them day passes, using cash. They rode some rides and then had a late lunch at Rock Lobster, the seafood place down by the concert hall. That was just past <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->->. As for the time of death, you probably know how they establish it. . . contents of the stomach and so on."
"Today it is lovely again, and along the Champs-Élysées at twilight it is like an outdoor seraglio choked with dark-eyed houris. The trees are in full foliage and of a verdure so pure, so rich, that it seems as though they were still wet and glistening with dew. From the Palais du Louvre to the Etoile it is like a piece of music for the pianoforte. For five days I have not touched the typewriter nor looked at a book; nor have I had a single idea in my head except to go to the American Express.

"“Oh, I’m a thinker all right,” McMurphy says, and they walk off together down the hall. When they come back what seems like days later, they’re both grinning and talking and happy about something. The doctor is wiping tears off his glasses and looks like he’s actually been laughing, and McMurphy is back as loud and full of brass and swagger as ever. He’s that way all through lunch, and at <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->-> he’s the first one in his seat for the meeting, his eyes blue and ornery from his place in the corner."
"He had a long-distance phone call from Portland and was down in the phone lobby with one of the black boys, waiting for the party to call again. When <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->-> came around and we went to moving things, getting the day room ready, the least black boy asked if she wanted him to go down and get McMurphy and Washington for the meeting, but she said no, it was all right, let him stay—besides, some of the men here might like a chance to discuss our Mr. Randle Patrick McMurphy in the absence of his dominating presence."
"“Can’t do it, Findle; I’m with somebody else! Call me up to-morrow about <-<-<-<one o’clock>->->->!”"

"Gottfried Rembke arrived at <-<-<-<1 pm>->->-> precisely. The moment he walked into the restaurant, handed his coat to the waiter, they knew it was him. The solid, stocky body, the gleaming pate, the open expression, the vigorous handshake: everything about him radiated ease and enthusiasm."
"I got to Schmidt's early, feeling horribly nervous. At <-<-<-<one o'clock>->->-> sharp: Toni. She was looking at the menu she knew well - Schmorbraten? Schnitzel? - when he loomed over her. I had seen him come in. She looked up, through him, at me. ""Traitor."" Jamie, hovering, looking very big, said her pet name, a German diminutive chosen by her."
"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking <-<-<-<thirteen>->->->."

"It was <-<-<-<a little after one o'clock>->->-> when I got there, time for lunch, so I had it. The food was awful. But it would go on the expense account, and after I'd eaten I got out my notebook and put it down. Lunch $1.50. Taxi $1.00."
"At <-<-<-<13:02>->->->.51, his implant-enhanced senses seared red-alert, and Trystin stiffened, fingers reaching, implant clicking in. As his direct-feed commands flared through the station net, he could sense the shields dropping into place even before the faint vibrations through the station confirmed the electroneural signals."
"Monday <-<-<-<1:03 P.M.>->->-><br>""Michael, I'm terribly glad you could make it."" Kenji Nogami smiled and reached for his pint of amber-colored lager. His tailoring was Savile Row via Bond Street, his accent Cambridge, his background well concealed. In a business where appearances counted for much, he had all the careful touches that separated the players from the pretenders—cheeks sleek from a daily workout at his club, eyes penetrating and always alert, hair graying at the temples."
"Jesus Christ! he gasped. ""It's <-<-<-<four minutes past one>->->->!"" Linden frantically seized hold of a pair of steps and began wandering about the room with them."

"At <-<-<-<five past one>->->-> Alleyn opened the outer door, knocked his pipe out on the edge of the stone step,and remained staring out on to the drive."

"Dr. Nexa accepted her forced surrender to the inevitable with a greater modicum of grace. She looked at Nurse L'Kem and said, pointing to the human, the Bolian, and then the Zaldan, ""Time of death for Lieutenant Hutchinson, <-<-<-<1307 hours>->->->."""
“I stopped at Mom’s classroom for the last few minutes of lunch. I closed the door behind me and sat down at a desk opposite her. I glanced up at the clock on the wall. <-<-<-<1:08>->->->. I had six minutes. I didn’t want more.”

"There it is! There it is! shouted the Professor. ""Now for the centre of the globe!"" he added in Danish.<br>I looked at Hans. ""Forüt!"" was his tranquil answer.<br>""Forward!"" replied my uncle. It was <-<-<-<thirteen minutes past one>->->->."

"<-<-<-<One seventeen>->->-> and four seconds. That shorter guy’s really got it made, and gets on a scooter, and that taller one, he goes in. One seventeen and forty seconds. That girl there, she’s got a green ribbon in her hair. Too bad that bus just cut her from view."
"<-<-<-<One eighteen>->->-> exactly. Was she stupid enough to head inside? Or wasn't she? We'll know before long, When the dead are carried out."
It was <-<-<-<past one in the afternoon>->->-> when the servant waked her and announced that M. Artynov had called. She dressed quickly and went down into the drawing-room.

"The clock marked <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes past one>->->->. He was suddenly full of agitation, yet hopeful. She had come! Who could tell what she would say? She might offer the most natural explanation of her late arrival. Félicie entered the room, her hair in disorder, her eyes shining, her cheeks white, her bruised lips a vivid red; she was tired, indifferent, mute, happy and lovely, seeming to guard beneath her cloak, which she held wrapped about her with both hands, some remnant of warmth and voluptuous pleasure."

"Monday, April 6<br><-<-<-<1:29 P.M.>->->-><br>As she hung up, Ally wondered again what she was getting into. But she did want to meet this miracle worker. The kind of thing Van de Vliet was talking about sounded as much like science fiction as anything she’d ever heard."
"At <-<-<-<one-thirty>->->-> she’s for hiring a carriage and driving through the Bois. He has only one thought in his head—how to take a leak? “I love you . . . . I adore you,” he says. “I’ll go anywhere you say—Istanbul, Singapore, Honolulu. Only I must go now. . . . It’s getting late.”"
"“I moved down here and painted the room black in high school. To be 𝘤𝘰𝘰𝘭,” Reva said sarcastically.<br>“It’s very cool,” I said. I put my shopping bag down, finished the coffee.<br>“When should I wake you up? We should leave here around <-<-<-<one thirty>->->->. So factor in whatever time you’ll need to get ready.”"
"Lupin not having come down, I went up again at <-<-<-<half-past one>->->->, and said we dined at two; he said he ""would be there."""
She was a sticker. A clock away in the town struck <-<-<-<half past one>->->->.
"Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of Harley Street nibbled at the June day, counselled submission, upheld authority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion, until the mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock, suspended above a shop in Oxford Street, announced, genially and fraternally, as if it were a pleasure to Messrs Rigby and Lowndes to give the information gratis, that it was <-<-<-<half-past one>->->->."
"Raymond came back with Masson <-<-<-<around one-thirty>->->->. His arm was bandaged up and he had an adhesive plaster on the corner of his mouth. The doctor had told him it was nothing, but Raymond looked pretty grim. Masson tried to make him laugh. But he still wouldn't say anything."
"I sat down on the couch again and looked at my watch It was <-<-<-<one thirty-two>->->->. I shut my eyes and focused on a spot in my head. My mind a total blank, I gave myself up to the sands of time and let the flow take me wherever it wanted."
"At the third stroke it will be <-<-<-<one ... thirty-two>->->-> ... and twenty seconds. 'Beep ... beep ... beep.' Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked laugh."
He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again on to the now empty cargo hold.'... <-<-<-<one ... thirty-three>->->-> ... and fifty seconds.' Very nice.
"At the third stroke it will be ...<br>He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin.<br>""... <-<-<-<one ... thirty-four>->->-> and twenty seconds.""<br>The voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in London, which he wasn't, not by a long way."
Fletcher checked his watch again. It was <-<-<-<1:35 P.M.>->->-> He sighed and asked the receptionist if he could use the washroom.
"<-<-<-<1:35 P.M.>->->-><br>Katelyn stood in the hallway, her hands on her hips, enjoying the hell out of the moment. “So I see how it is,” she said. “Your cousin can visit during finals week but my sister can’t.”"
"He had not dared to sleep in his rented car—you didn't sleep in your car when you worked for Jesus Castro—and he was beginning to hallucinate. Still, he was on the job, and he scribbled in his notebook: <-<-<-<1.37 pm>->->-> Subject appears to be getting laid."
"According to the digital readout inside my helmet, it was only <-<-<-<13:38>->->-> LT. The news that I wouldn't have to devote another three hours to painstaking cleanup should have cheered me considerably; instead, it rendered me about twenty times more suspicious."
"And it was now <-<-<-<1.39 p.m.>->->-> which was 23 minutes after the stop, which meant that we would be at the sea if the train didn't go in a big curve. But I didn't know if it went in a big curve."
"Glancing at his watch, Chandler-Powell saw that it was <-<-<-<one-forty>->->->. Perhaps he should now have a word with the Bostocks, who were closeted in the kitchen. He needed to check again that Kimberly had fully recovered and that they were giving thought to food."
"I will begin a few minutes before the leak started - at <-<-<-<1:41 pm>->->->, 13:41 Universal Time - one hour and twenty three minutes ago. At that point the chief flight engineer was attempting to discover why the engines had gone into automatic shutdown."
"<-<-<-<1:42 P.M.>->->-><br>Behind Chapin Hall was the official campus rehearsal and practice space building for more music students. Everyone called it the Beehive, because during school, the building emitted an atonal assemblage of strings, horns, and keys through its windows; Braque guessed that some imaginative people once likened it to the pleasant buzzing of insects."
The last note was recorded at <-<-<-<1.42 pm>->->->: G.M. on site at H-by; will take over the matter.
"There's a train at <-<-<-<seventeen minutes to two>->->->, said Didier. He blessed himself and got to his feet. He hesitated.<br>""What's the matter?""<br>""Shouldn't we say goodbye to Grandpa? He usually has a cheque for me."""
"By good luck, the next train was due at <-<-<-<forty-four minutes past one>->->->, and arrived at Yateland (the next station) ten minutes afterward."
"Let us know the moment Harvey leaves his box. My guess is that around <-<-<-<1:45>->->-> he’ll come and look at the runners and riders for the two o’clock, so that gives us a clear hour.”"
"That period which is always so dangerous, when the wicket is bad, the ten minutes before lunch, proved fatal to two more of the enemy. The last man had just gone to the wickets, with the score at a hundred and thirty-one, when a <-<-<-<quarter to two>->->-> arrived, and with it the luncheon interval."
"The blow fell at precisely <-<-<-<one forty-five>->->-> (summer-time). Benson, my Aunt Agatha's butler, was offering me the fried potatoes at the moment, and such was my emotion that I lofted six of them on the sideboard with the spoon."
"PAUL: I noticed Malatarsis right after Mama called me. At <-<-<-<1346 hours>->->-> on Thursday the twenty-fourth. Brett was killed at least fourteen hours later, in the wee hours of the twenty-fifth."
"Poppy was sprawled on Brianne's bed, applying black mascara to her stubby lashes. Brianne was sitting at her desk, trying to complete an essay before the 2 pm deadline. It was <-<-<-<1.47 pm>->->->."
"It was <-<-<-<twelve minutes to two>->->-> in the afternoon when Claude Moreau and his most-trusted field officer, Jacques Bergeron, arrived at the Georges Cinq station of the Paris Metro. They walked, separately, to the rear of the platform, each carrying a handheld radio, the frequencies calibrated to each other."
"The bookstall clerk had seen the passenger in grey pass the bookstall at <-<-<-<1.49>->->->, in the direction of the exit."
"She had to get out of this goddamn camper. It might be the biggest, luxiest one in the world, but right now it felt the size of a coffin. She made her way to the door, holding onto things to keep her balance. She glanced at the clock on the dashboard before she went out. <-<-<-<Ten to two>->->->. Everything had happened in just twenty minutes. Incredible."
Rahel's toy wristwatch had the time painted on it. <-<-<-<Ten to two>->->->. One of her ambitions was to own a watch on which she could change the time whenever she wanted to (which according to her was what Time was meant for in the first place).
The best train of the day was the <-<-<-<one-fifty>->->-> from Paddington which reached Polgarwith just after seven o'clock.
"Which meant that now, at <-<-<-<1:51 p.m.>->->->, lower Manhattan was a nightmare. Wall Street had been cordoned off for blocks in each direction. Foot police redirected traffic on Broadway, blowing whistles and gesturing impatiently."
"He passed through the Damascus Gate into the International Zone at <-<-<-<eight minutes to two>->->->, carefully avoiding the telltale times of the hour, the half hour, and the quarter hour. The he began to wander aimlessly, trying to mimic an idling, stolling interest in his surroundings that he was very far from feeling."
"I came to your door to tell you. It is near to your luncheon hour. Yes; <-<-<-<eight minutes to two>->->->. Vivian will be at luncheon. I don't lunch, but I don't mind going in. I must not let him slip through my fingers."
"Mr. Jackson, exclaimed Mr. Rossiter. ""I really must ask you to be good enough to come in from your lunch at the proper time. It was fully <-<-<-<seven minutes to two>->->-> when you returned, and-"""
"At the moment museum officials do not believe anything was stolen from the collection. The museum and church, which are popular tourist attractions, will be closed to the public until further notice.<br><-<-<-<1:54 PM>->->-> - 05/05/2014"
"At <-<-<-<1:55>->->-> he returned to the insurance records until the fifteen-minute tea break at four o’clock, which was another ritual occasion for two more cigarettes."
"If I was punctual in quitting Mlle. Reuter's domicile, I was at least equally punctual in arriving there; I came the next day at <-<-<-<five minutes before two>->->->, and on reaching the schoolroom door, before I opened it, I heard a rapid, gabbling sound, which warned me that the ""priere du midi"" was not yet concluded."
"<-<-<-<1:56 P.M.>->->-><br>Happily, Katelyn was out of the dorm room, off doing whatever the hell she did on campus, so Braque could type her computer passwords for Eva without worrying about her cooze of a roommate getting them."
"Then I opened my eyes and looked at my watch. It was <-<-<-<one fifty-seven>->->->. Twenty-five minutes had vanished somewhere. Not bad, I told myself. A pointless way of whittling away time. Not bad at all."
"It was <-<-<-<three minutes to two>->->->. ""I hope you can catch him, then. Thank you. I really appreciate it."""
"Promptly at <-<-<-<two minutes to two>->->-> that afternoon, the two majors presented themselves to General Austin's temporary secretary at his away-from-Pentagon office."
"It was <-<-<-<almost two o’clock>->->->, but nothing moved, Stari Teočak was silent and so empty it seemed abandoned, and yet Tijmen constantly felt he was being observed by invisible eyes."
"For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship's computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, and close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. ""<-<-<-<One ... fifty-nine>->->-> …"""
"“Where exactly? And when? We’ll need to be there.”<br>“The square. On the steps of the old library.” She glanced to the clock above the pub. “<-<-<-<Two hours past midday>->->->, I believe.”"
"An awful silence followed this remark, which was broken by Peter saying, “Giant Wimbleweather and the Bear and Centaur Glenstorm shall be our marshals. The combat will be at <-<-<-<two hours after noon>->->->. Dinner at noon precisely.”"
"There was a most friendly parting, and when she sailed, <-<-<-<two hours after noon>->->->, all the Dufflepuds paddled out with her to the harbor mouth, and cheered until she was out of the sound of their cheering."
"Mrs. Karlsson's eyes were big with surprise when at <-<-<-<two o'clock>->->-> she saw the pastor coming to dinner in this civilian elegance, which besides the suit and red tie, included colored socks and tan shoes. He offered no word of explanation. As usual, he carried under his arm a book with some unintelligible title, and from which he read the entire meal."
"Jesiba didn’t bother answering, instead saying, “I’ve got a client coming in at <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->->. Be ready. And stop letting Lehabah prattle. She has a job to do.” The line went dead."
"At <-<-<-<two>->->-> that afternoon, Bryant Brown sat numbly in his chair beside his sleeping wife, wondering how he could tell her that their only child was dead, if it became necessary to do so."
"It’s only <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->->. She left the office early, telling Dr. Van Vleet she felt she was coming down with something. Really it’s Nate who is coming down with something: he phones from his house, nasal, forlorn, he has to see her."
"It’s a delusional painter who finishes a canvas at <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> and expects radical societal transformation by four. Even when artists write manifestos, they are (hopefully) aware that their exigent tone is, finally, borrowed, only echoing and mimicking the urgency of the guerrilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests, rather than truly enacting it. The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art."
"Things started to break up around <-<-<-<two in the afternoon>->->->. We could have stayed for supper, could have stayed - if Mr Corcoran’s drunken invitations held true (Mrs Corcoran’s frosty smile behind his back informed us that they did not) indefinitely."
"At <-<-<-<2 p.m.>->->-> on a weekday, the movie theater was almost deserted, but three people sat two rows back from Andi Steiner and her date. Two men, one quite old and one appearing on the edge of middle age (but appearances could be deceiving), flanked a woman of startling beauty. Her cheekbones were high, her eyes were gray, her complexion creamy. Her masses of black hair were tied back with a broad velvet ribbon."
"At <-<-<-<two>->->-> every afternoon, the mother and son would appear at the beach. The mother always wore a plain light-colored dress with a broad-brimmed straw hat. The son never wore a hat; he had on sunglasses instead. They’d sit in the shade below the palm trees, the breeze rustling around them, and stare off at the ocean, not really doing anything."
"“You can take a nap in my room,” she said. “It should be quiet down there. My relatives are over, but they won’t think you’re being rude or anything. We don’t have to be at the funeral home until <-<-<-<two>->->->.”"
"We followed along the High Street at a reasonable distance, giggling, dodging past people, separating and coming together again. It must have been around <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> by then, and the pavement was busy with shoppers."
"The next few hours are shutter-snaps. Pictures like on her phone. She blinks and there’s a picture. Blinks again and there’s something else. She looks at her watch and it’s <-<-<-<2 p.m.>->->->, looks a moment later and it’s half past. She couldn’t worry about anything if she tried. It’s good."
"At <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> the doctor begins to squirm around in his chair. The meetings are uncomfortable for the doctor unless he’s talking about his theory; he’d rather spend his time down in his office, drawing on graphs."
"He told her if he had any of his weekends free he’d ask her for a date, and she said she could come to visit in two weeks if he’d tell her what time, and Billy looked at McMurphy for an answer. McMurphy put his arms around both of their shoulders and said, “Let’s make it <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> on the nose.”"
"One afternoon, I don’t recall how long back, we stopped on our way to activities and sat around the lobby on the big plastic sofas or outside in the <-<-<-<two-o’clock>->->-> sun while one of the black boys used the phone to call his bookmaker, and Billy’s mother took the opportunity to leave her work and come out from behind her desk and take her boy by the hand and lead him outside to sit near where I was on the grass."
"As Big Ben struck <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> the door opened and the top half of Cleverly’s body appeared. “Anything?”<br>“No, sir.”<br>“The line still working?”<br>“I believe so.”<br>“We’ll give it another five minutes and then the PM will have to go.”<br>The door closed."
"At <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->-> back at the Weatherbys’ Sally asked her if she and Amory had had a “time” in the den. Isabelle turned to her quietly. In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate dreamer of Joan-like dreams."
“How odd… I’m almost happy. And yet I suppose I’m actually in danger… Somehow - now - nothing seems to matter… not in daylight… I feel full of power - I feel that I can’t die…”<br>Blore was looking at his wrist-watch. He said:<br>“It’s <-<-<-<two o’clock>->->->. What about lunch?”
"She could have fired the jig, and he could have kept on picking up his packages at the old time, <-<-<-<two o'clock>->->->. As it was, he had almost been arrested."
At approximately <-<-<-<1400 hours>->->-> a pair of enemy Skyhawks came flying in at deck level out of nowhere.
At <-<-<-<two o'clock>->->-> Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool.
"At <-<-<-<two>->->->, the snowplows were in action in Lillestrom."
"I caught the <-<-<-<two o'clock>->->-> bus. It was very hot. I ate at Céleste's restaurant as usual. They all felt very sorry for me and Céleste told me, ""There's no one like a mother."""
"The Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers. With the <-<-<-<two o'clock>->->-> bus I should get there well before nightfall. Then I can spend the night there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back here by tomorrow evening."
When Salander woke up it was <-<-<-<2.00>->->-> on Saturday afternoon and a doctor was poking at her.
"At <-<-<-<about two o'clock>->->-> the owner's young wife came, carrying a handleless cup and a pot with a quilted cover, to where I was still lying disconsolate."
"The next day was Saturday and, now that Moon was done, I decided to bring the job to its end. So I sent word that I shouldn't be able to umpire for the team at Steeple Sinderby and, after working through the morning, came down <-<-<-<about two o'clock>->->->."
"The express departed from Birmingham with the nicest exactitude, and covered itself with glory as far as Watford, when it ran into a mist, and lost more than a quarter of an hour, besides ruining Arthur's career. Arthur arrived in London at <-<-<-<one minute past two>->->->."
"At the fatal stroke of the clock the whole assembly rushed from their places as if a fire had broken out. When I asked a colleague what it all meant, the old notary, who had heard my question, replied: 'The primary duty of a Government employe is punctuality, sir!' At <-<-<-<two minutes past two>->->-> not a soul was left in one of the rooms."
"I'm not dead. How did that happen? He was right. It was <-<-<-<14.02>->->-> and twenty-six seconds. Destiny had not been fulfilled. We all looked at each other, confused."
"It was <-<-<-<three minutes after two in the afternoon>->->->, and the Battle of Tahuma had begun."
"<-<-<-<2.04 pm>->->->. Once again, the Quartermaster-General's office came on the line asking for Colonel Finckh, and once again Finckh heard the quiet, unemotional, unfamiliar voice"
"...and at <-<-<-<five past two>->->-> on 17 September of that same unforgettable year 1916, I was in the Muryovo hospital yard, standing on trampled withered grass, flattened by the September rain."
"A man driving a tractor saw her, four hundred yards from her house, <-<-<-<six minutes past two>->->-> in the afternoon."
"<-<-<-<2:07 P.M.>->->->, SUNDAY, JUNE 8TH, 1924<br>WHEN GEORGE LOOKED up again, it appeared as if the peak was within touching distance, despite the altimeter warning him that they still had over 300 feet to climb."
"He poked his head into Tonay's office at about <-<-<-<seven minutes past two>->->-> and said, ""Sarge, I'm pretty sure something's happening with the Buick."""
"At <-<-<-<eight minutes past two>->->->, the gloomy-faced man, standing by the wide y of steps that led down from the balcony, craned his neck and discovered Monk Mayfair, Ham Brooks, Daniel W. Lochaber and Elma Champion."
"Mr. Tyne, said Butler, ""left the North Tower lobby at <-<-<-<14:09>->->-> by up tube on the elevators and arrived at the chess tournament on the sixtieth level at 14:10."""
"He arrived at her house at <-<-<-<2:10 P.M.>->->->, two videotapes in one hand, and a single bag of uncooked microwave popcorn in the other."
"Mrs. Eunice Harris pulls back the sleeve of her good coat and checks her good watch. ""Indeed yes. Half twelve,"" and waves a hand at the Town Hall clock as if it was hers. ""Always <-<-<-<ten past two>->->->. Someone put a nail in the time years back."""
"The phone machine announced in an electronic voice, ""You have one message, at <-<-<-<two-eleven P.M.>->->->""<br>Then an unctuous male voice came on. ""Kirby, we know you're there. You're still in treatment. You shouldn't be wandering around unsupervised. It's a lot better, a lot safer, for you to stay with us now."""
"Seb looked up at the clock on the wall: <-<-<-<2:12 p.m.>->->-> At this rate, he’d be lucky to get more than forty minutes with Mellor, although he suspected the man would have his pitch well prepared and wouldn’t waste any time."
"However, they should not forget that another man had lost his life, and if Danny Cartwright did not kill Bernie Wilson, they might well ask, who else could possibly have committed the crime?<br>At <-<-<-<twelve minutes past two>->->->, the jury filed out of the court to begin their deliberations."
"At the third stroke, it will be <-<-<-<two ... thirteen>->->-> ... and fifty seconds."
"The clock inlaid with mother-of-pearl, which would not run, stopped at some <-<-<-<fourteen minutes past two o'clock>->->-> of a dead and forgotten day and time, which had been his mother's dowry."
"<-<-<-<2:15 P.M.>->->-><br>Mark finished his lunch. Two other men finished their sandwiches and also rose to leave. Mark quickly returned to the Senate, as he wanted to catch Henry Lykham before the floor debate started."
<-<-<-<2:15 p.m.>->->-> Story in papers about two-year-olds having to take tests to get into nursery school just made me jump out of my skin. Am supposed to be at tea party for godson Harry's birthday.
"I had a date with her next day at <-<-<-<2.15 P.M.>->->-> In my own rooms, but it was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight."
<-<-<-<2.15 p.m.>->->-> Second afternoon class
"Oh, good evening. I think you were on the barrier when I came in at <-<-<-<2.16>->->-> this afternoon. Now, do you know that you let me get past without giving up my ticket? Yes, yes he-he! I really think you ought to be more careful."
"I only know that she used to go every Tuesday and Thursday by the <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past two>->->-> train from Baker St., and be back by six o'clock, so it couldn't have been very far."
"<-<-<-<2:18 P.M.>->->-><br>Pierre Armont was forty-six, with gray temples and a body appropriate to an Olympic wrestler. He had full cheeks, a heavy mustache, and suspicious dark eyes that constantly searched his surroundings. It was an innate survival instinct."
"Andrea Mitchell appears on a split screen. “Chet, we understand from a source at Homeland Security that the explosion happened at <-<-<-<two-nineteen P.M.>->->-> I don’t know how the authorities can pinpoint the time that exactly, but apparently they can.”"
<-<-<-<2:19>->->->: Duane Hinton walks out. He walks through the backyard. He lugs some clothes. He wore said clothes last night. He walks to the fence. He feeds the incinerator. He lights a match.
"He checked his watch: <-<-<-<2:20 p.m.>->->-> Kickoff at 3:00. Forty thousand fans were all heading in the same direction. The majority were wearing red-and-white scarves, although a large contingent wore blue-and-white."
"<-<-<-<Twenty past two>->->->. Want to go back to the hotel for a while?<br>""All right.""<br>They walked out of the gardens and down the rue de Vaugirard. This holiday, unlike those holidays long ago, would not end with her sleeping at home. Two nights from now I will be high over the Atlantic Ocean and on Saturday I will be walking around in the Other Place. I am going to America. I am starting my life over again."
She looked at her watch and it was <-<-<-<twenty minutes past two>->->->. She had no time to lose but must get ready at once.
"The watch found at the Weir was challenged by the jeweller as one he had wound and set for Edwin Drood, at <-<-<-<twenty minutes past two>->->-> on that same afternoon; and it had run down, before being cast into the water; and it was the jeweller's positive opinion that it had never been re-wound."
"<-<-<-<Twenty minutes after two>->->->, on my way to San Diego, listening to some weird, cacophanous music; no melodic line, no content."
"Ned looked around in puzzlement, and it was a long moment before he could account for his surroundings. When he had, he sat up very quickly and gave a startled look at his watch. The thing was crazy! It said <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes past two>->->->!"
"Garth here. Sunday afternoon. Sorry to miss you, but I'll leave a brief message on your tape. <-<-<-<Two-twenty-two>->->-> or there-aboutish. Great party."
"<-<-<-<Twenty-three minutes past two>->->->, he announced.<br>""Never!"" ejaculated Crosthwaite incredulously. ""Surely I haven't——""<br>""Yes, you have,"" interrupted Devereux with a laugh. ""Seven and three-quarter hours of solid sleep! Sorry I disturbed you."""
"“It’s just a plain every-day fog,” he said. “But it’s certainly a wonder. What time is it? Who’s got a watch?”<br>“<-<-<-<Two twenty-three>->->->,” replied Evan. “I’ll have to hurry or I won’t get down in time for football practice.”"
"The Fokker lifted off from the Nairobi runway at <-<-<-<14:24 hours>->->->, three minutes ahead of their new timeline schedule."
"Simon arrived at <-<-<-<two-twenty-five>->->->, five minutes before his meeting with the party leader. He had tried not to speculate as to why Heath wanted to see him, in case the meeting only resulted in disappointment."
"There was a moment today, at <-<-<-<2:25>->->->, when study hall came suddenly to life. Heads were lifted and cocked as the siren in the belfry of the city hall announced trouble, probably a fire, somewhere in Staggerford."
"The three of us mooched about the office, making aimless conversation, glancing with studied carelessness into the front street, whistling little tunes to ourselves. By <-<-<-<two twenty-five>->->-> we had all fallen silent."
"Gary shut himself inside his office and flipped through the messages. Caroline had called at 1:35, 1:40, 1:50, 1:55, and 2:10; it was now <-<-<-<2:25>->->->. He pumped his fist in triumph. Finally, finally, some evidence of desperation."
"It was <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes past two>->->->, but the place was still crowded with the lunch-hour rush."
The hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the Bloomsbury Centre's four thousand rooms marked <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past two>->->->.
It happened to be the case that the sixty-based system coincided with our our current method of keeping time... Apparently they wanted us to know that that something might happen at <-<-<-<28 minutes and 57 seconds after 2 pm>->->-> on a day yet to be specified.
"Thursday <-<-<-<2:28 P.M.>->->-><br>""The hypersonic test flight must proceed as scheduled,"" Tanzan Mino said quietly. ""Now that all the financial arrangements have been completed, the Coordinating Committee of the LDP has agreed to bring the treaty before the Diet next week. A delay is unthinkable."""
"His awakening faculty would seem to have been slightly out of order that day, however, and he did not arouse until <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes past two>->->-> by the hotel clock."
"At <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes past two>->->-> on Monday, Lucy tapped at their sitting-room door and said, ""If you please, sir, there is a man in black downstairs with a young gentleman."""
She looked at her watch: <-<-<-<half past two>->->->. A few minutes to calm down before she had to go.
"So I opened the door again, got out a piece of paper and a thumbtack, and wrote:<br>Out briefly. Back for appointment at <-<-<-<2:30>->->->. Dresden<br>That done, I went to the stairs and started down. I rarely use the elevator, even though I’m on the fifth floor. Like I said, I don’t trust machines. They’re always breaking down on me just when I need them"
"Ach! It's <-<-<-<2:30>->->->. Look how the time is flying. And it's still so much to do today.. It's dishes to clean, dinner to defrost, and my pills I haven't yet counted. I don't get it... Why didn't the Jews at least try to resist? It wasn't so easy like you think. Everybody was so starving and frightened, and tired they couldn't believe even what's in front of their eyes."
"At <-<-<-<2.30 pm>->->-> on the 13th inst. began to shadow Sir Bobadil the Ostrich, whom I suspect of being the criminal. Shadowing successful. Didn't lose sight of him once."
At <-<-<-<half past two>->->-> the same afternoon the boy and the elderly man are standing in the room directly above the Inner Office and Waiting-Room.
"It was <-<-<-<half-past two>->->-> in the afternoon. The sun hung in the faded blue sky like a burning mirror, and away beyond the paddocks the blue mountains quivered and leapt like sea. Sid wouldn't be back until half-past ten. He had ridden over to the township with four of the boys to help hunt down the young fellow who'd murdered Mr. Williamson. Such a dreadful thing!"
"It was <-<-<-<half-past two>->->-> o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage a deux mains and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and announced ""Dr. Van Helsing."""
"May 14th 1800. Wm and John set off into Yorkshire after dinner at <-<-<-<1/2 past 2 o'clock>->->->, cold pork in their pockets. I left them at the turning of the Low-wood bay under the trees. My heart was so full that I could barely speak to W. when I gave him a farewell kiss."
Igor checked the time again. He didn't really; I'm just getting back to the story. It was now <-<-<-<thirty-one minutes past two>->->-> and she (he) was officially late.
"Like <-<-<-<2.32 p.m.>->->->, Beecher and Avalon, L3 R2 (which meant left three blocks, right two) 2:35 p.m., and you wondered how you could pick up one box, then drive 5 blocks in 3 minutes and be finished cleaning out another box."
At that moment his aunt appeared at the side of her cottage and gazed up the headland. Dalgliesh glanced at his wrist. It was <-<-<-<thirty-three minutes past two>->->->. He let in the clutch and the Cooper Bristol bumped slowly down the track towards her.
"At <-<-<-<two thirty-four p.m.>->->->, precisely, in the largest and most luxurious of the private rooms, Sister Brumfett lost a patient. She always thought of death that way. The patient was lost; the battle was over; she, Sister Brumfett, had been personally defeated."
"Like 2.32 p.m., Beecher and Avalon, L3 R2 (which meant left three blocks, right two) <-<-<-<2:35 p.m.>->->->, and you wondered how you could pick up one box, then drive 5 blocks in 3 minutes and be finished cleaning out another box."
"“Drive safe,” says Ned. He texted me to send the van. That was at <-<-<-<2:36>->->->, I know because I looked at the clock, the art deco one right over there, see? Keeps perfect time. Then, I dunno, he just vanished."
I look at my watch. <-<-<-<Two thirty-six>->->->. All I've got left today is take in the laundry and fix dinner.
"However, what he hadn’t anticipated was that it would stop at every station from Finsbury Park to Stevenage, so by the time the train finally puffed into Cambridge, the station clock showed <-<-<-<2:37 P.M.>->->->"
"<-<-<-<2:37 P.M.>->->-><br>The conduit was roughly a meter and a half in diameter and pitch dark. He had expected that and had extracted a waterproof flashlight from an emergency kit in the wreckage of the Hind. It was helping, but not all that much. With the heat exchangers off, no water was flowing. The stone walls were merely moist, the curved sides covered with slime."
"<-<-<-<2:38 P.M.>->->-><br>""Abdoullah"" had finished unpacking the second crate, and now he examined what he had: two fifteen-kiloton nuclear devices, made using enriched uranium-235 from the Kahuta Nuclear Research Center. He smiled again to think they had been smuggled out right from under the noses of the officials at Kahuta, directly up the security elevators leading down to the U235 centrifuge at Level Five."
"The bus continued on its way into Bristol, a journey he would normally cover in about twelve minutes in the Lagonda, but today it took over an hour before they finally pulled into the bus station. Hugo was neither the first nor the last passenger to get off. He checked his watch: <-<-<-<2:38 p.m.>->->-> He’d left himself enough time."
"Noo, there's a report come in fra' the station-master at Pinwherry that there was a gentleman tuk the <-<-<-<2.39>->->-> at Pinwherry."
"“I’ve already explained to the fellow that the only <-<-<-<two-forty>->->-> I know is the bus that runs between Golders Green and Edgware, and if I don’t get a move on, I’ll miss my beloved 14,” said Lawrence, checking his watch."
"If a girl looks swell when she meets you, who gives a damn if she’s late? Nobody. “We better hurry,” I said. “The show starts at <-<-<-<two-forty>->->->.”"
"Members of Big Side marked Michael and Alan as the two most promising three-quarters for Middle Side next year, and when the bell sounded at <-<-<-<twenty minutes to three>->->->, the members of Big Side would walk with Michael and Alan towards the changing room and encourage them by flattery and genial ragging."
"<-<-<-<Nineteen minutes to three>->->->. “No need to rush,” she told Emma when there was a knock on the door. She was sure she’d hung the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob and told the chauffeur not to expect them before three."
"At <-<-<-<2.41>->->->, when the afternoon fast train to London was pulling out of Larborough prompt to the minute, Miss Pym sat under the cedar on the lawn wondering whether she was a fool, and not caring much anyhow."
"It was <-<-<-<two-forty-two>->->->. Clarissa has asked to be called at two-forty-five but a few minutes could hardly matter. She knocked, quietly at first, and then more loudly. There was no reply."
At <-<-<-<14:42>->->-> precisely I saw a plasm tether descend from the sky and pause outside the apartment as if it contained a sensorium that was doing some surveilling of its own.
"<-<-<-<2:42 P.M.>->->-><br>""No!"" Cally screamed, but it was already too late. Before Chris Schneider even saw it coming, Ramirez shot him precisely between the eyes, neatly and without fanfare."
"The <-<-<-<14.43>->->-> pulled into Tunbridge Wells on time, and William was the first person off the train. He joined the little posse awaiting him."
"Right! Let's get on with it. You know what we want, a full account of where you were, what you were doing, and whom you saw between one o'clock when lunch was over and <-<-<-<two-forty-three>->->-> when Miss Gray found the body."
"<-<-<-<2:43 P.M.>->->-><br>Vance watched the control room freeze as the body slumped to the floor, and he felt his fingers involuntarily bunch into a fist. The bastards were killing hostages already. They definitely were terrorists, right out of the textbook. Kill one, and frighten a thousand. Except they might not stop with one. He foresaw a long day. And night."
Jacobson died at <-<-<-<2.43 pm>->->-> the next day after slashing his wrists with a razor blade in the second cubicle from the left in the men's washroom on the third floor.
"Then he began to breathe more freely; “the girl,” as he always mentally dubbed her, could not enter the grounds now without his seeing her. He looked at his watch for the third time—<-<-<-<seventeen minutes to three>->->->. Just about the time he had planned. She should be here soon if she had left Miss Lloyd’s a little after two."
A carriage clock in a window two up from the milliner's was showing <-<-<-<sixteen minutes to three>->->-> when I turned round and saw Bruno no more than fifty yards from me.
"David arrived at <-<-<-<2:45 P.M.>->->-> at the Copley Hotel on Huntingdon Avenue, the adrenaline pumping through his body. He repeated the Harvard Business School motto to himself as he was ushered into a small private room: look British, think Yiddish."
"He glanced down at his watch. He had been smiling as he stroked her awake, and was smiling now. “<-<-<-<Quarter to three>->->->. I sat in my stupid old motel room for almost two hours after we talked, trying to convince myself that what I was thinking couldn’t be true. Only I didn’t get where I am by dodging the truth.”"
The young tinker girl knocked at the back door at <-<-<-<quarter to three in the afternoon>->->->. Marjan recognized her as one of the many freckled faces that lingered at the café windows long after other curious schoolchildren had left their mucky handprints behind.
He never came down till a <-<-<-<quarter to three>->->->.
"Pull the other one, and tell it to the marines, and don't make me laugh, and fuck off out of it, and all that, but the fact remained that it was still only <-<-<-<two forty-five>->->->'."
"What time is it?<br>""Look for yourself,"" the old woman says to me. I look, and I see the clock has no hands.<br>""There are no hands,"" I say.<br>The old woman looks at the clock face and says to me, ""It's a <-<-<-<quarter to three>->->->."""
"The irony had come about unconsciously. Micheal had roamed the Palatine that morning, selecting the site for the very advantage that now could be used against him. He looked at his watch: <-<-<-<fourteen minutes to three>->->->."
"The walls here were painted yellow, not red as they had been on Level I. The people wore yellow uniforms. A nurse by the elevator said, ""The time is <-<-<-<2:47 p.m.>->->->, gentlemen. You may continue your descent in one hour."""
"<-<-<-<2:48 P.M.>->->-><br>Rais had finished retrieving the box of krytrons from the cockpit of the Huey and was headed down the elevator for the area directly below and south of the launch facility, the clean room where SatCom's expensive communications satellites were going to be prepped for launch."
"Endicott stared back at him and thought. Five thousand dollars up front and five thousand after to create a major shunt on Interstate 50 at mile marker 107, shunt to occur at <-<-<-<14:49 hours>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<2:50>->->-> he called for them all to join him in the Members’ Enclosure to look at his famous filly. Stephen, like the others, trailed behind him in a little pseudo-royal entourage."
"When it was <-<-<-<2:50>->->-> and the bank, too, had not been attacked, it was clear this was not the day of the big coup."
Stands the Church clock at <-<-<-<ten to three>->->->? And is there honey still for tea?
"At <-<-<-<nine minutes to three>->->->, the storm came back. It rolled in on angry, brooding tiers: swollen blue-black cumulus and ghostly, low-slung nimbostratus, crowding the ceiling of the sky. It made the oxygen in the air itself compress, turn chill and thick, absorbed or displaced by the moisture that blackened and bloated the heavens."
"Mr. Kesselbach, it is <-<-<-<eight minutes to three>->->->. If you don't answer within eight minutes from now, you are a dead man!"
"At <-<-<-<2:53>->->-> they were ushered into an empty conference room. Scott selected a chair against the wall, just behind where Warren Christopher would be seated but slightly to his left so he would have a clear view of Prime Minister Rabin across the table."
"“And what do you suppose Father Mahoney is thinking now, sitting there like some Romanian beggar and just before teatime? He knows very well we’re expecting him. If he’s even one minute late—I’m counting, it’s <-<-<-<seven minutes to three>->->-> on my watch—I’ll be telling him a thing or two.”"
"grand ducal troikas with clinking harnesses studded with metal plaques and flying tassels, the outer horses coquetting, as usual, beside the staid trot of the shaft-horse,--all mingle in the endless procession which flows on up the Nevsky Prospekt through the Bolshaya Morskaya,--Great Sea Street,--and out upon the Neva quays, and back again, to see and be seen, until long after the sun has set on the short days, at <-<-<-<six minutes to three>->->->."
"In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn’t cope with, and that terrible listlessness that starts to set in <-<-<-<about 2.55>->->->, when you know you’ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o’clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul."
"At <-<-<-<two fifty-five>->->->, ten men and two women, all of whom were dressed in what looked to Daphne like long black dressing gowns with purple scarves hanging from their necks, proceeded across the stage in a gentle crocodile before taking their allocated places."
"At <-<-<-<five minutes to three>->->-> Paolo and his best man entered the chapel and walked slowly down the aisle. Gian Lorenzo knew he’d been a well-known footballer, but he still couldn’t remember his name."
"The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. <-<-<-<Five to three>->->->. Just nice time to walk to Artane."
"At <-<-<-<2.55 that afternoon>->->->, she parked across the road from her daughter’s school and waited for the students to emerge. She hadn’t slept at all. Her eyes ached, and there was a fuzzy heat in her head."
"<-<-<-<2.56 P.M.>->->-> Helen is alone now. Her face is out of frame, and through the viewfinder I see only a segment of the pillow, an area of crumpled sheet and the upper section of her chest and shoulders."
"He left the house at <-<-<-<three minutes to three>->->->, carrying his cloak over his arm. It was a hot day at the beginning of June, and when he stepped out at the door the air of the street smote his face like a blast from an open furnace. He reeled and almost fell."
"It was <-<-<-<two minutes to three>->->-> and Blackie was sitting alone at her desk. She was oppressed by a listlessness which was partly the result of delayed shock, partly fear, but which made any action seem an intolerable exertion. She supposed she could go home, although no one had told her so."
"But generally it’s the other way, the slow way. She’ll turn that dial to a dead stop and freeze the sun there on the screen so it don’t move a scant hair for weeks, so not a leaf on a tree or a blade of grass in the pasture shimmers. The clock hands hang at <-<-<-<two minutes to three>->->-> and she’s liable to let them hang there till we rust."
"From twenty minutes past nine until twenty-seven minutes past nine, from twenty-five minutes past eleven until twenty-eight minutes past eleven, from ten minutes to three until <-<-<-<two minutes to three>->->-> the heroes of the school met in a large familiarity whose Olympian laughter awed the fearful small boy that flitted uneasily past and chilled the slouching senior that rashly paused to examine the notices in assertion of an unearned right."
We betted that it would happen on the morrow; they took us up and gave us the odds of two to one; we betted that it would happen in the afternoon; we got odds of four to one on that; we betted that it would happen at <-<-<-<two minutes to three>->->->; they willingly granted us the odds of ten to one on that.
"At <-<-<-<one minute to three>->->->, five senior staffers entered the room, and Scott was pleased to see that Susan Anderson was among them."
"<-<-<-<About three o’clock>->->-> the four couples, frightened at their happiness, were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the Champs Élysées."
"A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of one or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr 8 m p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time), the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at <-<-<-<2.59 p.m.>->->->"
"The bell in the clock tower in the village square chimed <-<-<-<three>->->->. Declan straightened against the stone wall, careful to stay hidden in the shadows as he watched the pub from the alley across the street."
Gunther's two conflicting feelings about Christmas almost rubbed each other out on the First Sunday in Advent. By <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->-> the fear feeling had practically vanished.
"At <-<-<-<three>->->-> that afternoon it was Peter who raised her from the semidaze in which she had been working, making her aware she was two damn-nears: damn-near starving and damn-near exhausted."
"The little velociraptor opened her jaws and hissed at Grant, in a posture of sudden intense fury.<br>“Fascinating,” Grant said.<br>“Can I stay and play with her?” Tim said.<br>“Not right now,” Ed Regis said, glancing at his watch. “<-<-<-<It’s three o’clock>->->->, and it’s a good time for a tour of the park itself, so you can see all the dinosaurs in the habitats we have designed for them.”"
<-<-<-<Three o’clock>->->-> is always too late or too early for anything you want to do. An odd moment in the afternoon.
"A few moments later, about <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->->, Courfeyrec chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air."
"At <-<-<-<three o’clock on the afternoon>->->-> there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic."
"“Then good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> I should like to chat this little matter over with you.”"
"The next afternoon at <-<-<-<three>->->->, I went to meet the new teacher. When I stepped inside Julian’s office I was shocked. It was completely empty. The books, the rugs, the big round table were all gone."
"At about <-<-<-<three o’clock in the afternoon>->->->, my whole body is hit by an overwhelming tiredness and I spent the last couple of hours of the day perusing the gift shop for stuffed koalas for Kay and Olivia and chilling out at a table inside the air-conditioned café."
"All the doors were locked, everything in its proper place. Nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to the janitor’s room, set my alarm for <-<-<-<three>->->->, and fell fast asleep."
"When the alarm went off at <-<-<-<three>->->->, though, I woke up feeling weird. I can’t explain it, but I just felt different. I didn’t feel like getting up—it was like something was suppressing my will to get out of bed. I’m the type who usually leaps right out of bed, so I couldn’t understand it."
"Luisa crosses the office to Dom Grelsch’s door. Her boss is speaking on the phone in a low, irate voice. Luisa waits outside but overhears. “No—no, no, Mr, Frum, it 𝘪𝘴 black-and-white, tell me—hey, 𝘐’𝘮 talking now—tell me a 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 black-and-white ‘condition’ than leukemia? Know what I think? I think my wife is just one piece of paperwork between you and your <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> golf slot, isn’t she?”"
"Jarvis whistled through his teeth. “Will the law help a man of your years bounce back from multiple spinal fractures, Timothy?”<br>Eddie: “Men of your age don’t bounce. They splat.”<br>I fought with all my might, but my sphincter was no longer my own and a cannonade fired off. Amusement or condescension I could have borne, but my tormentors’ pity signified my abject defeat. The toilet chain was pulled.<br>“<-<-<-<Three o’clock>->->->,” Cavendish-Redux went down the pan."
"I had pushed too hard. “Damn it to hell, Tim, my bank 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘦𝘥! We were bled dry by those bloodsuckers at Lloyds! The days when I had that kind of spondulics at my beck and call are gone, gone, gone! Out house is mortgaged, twice over! I’m the mighty fallen, you’re the miniscule fallen. Anyway, you’ve got this ruddy book flying out of every bookshop in the known world!”<br>My face said what I had no words for.<br>“Oh Christ, you idiot. What’s the repayment schedule?”<br>I looked at my watch. “<-<-<-<Three o’clock>->->-> this afternoon.”"
"By <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->->, the heat had morphed into a feral creature, a snake bent on prey. It hissed and slithered across the pavements, poked its flaming tongue through keyholes. People inched closer t their fans, sucked harder on ice cubes and opened the windows, only to close them instantly."
"When the clock struck <-<-<-<three>->->->, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present."
"I sat down on the woodpile we kept under a swatch of canvas on this side of the house. “I imagine you’re out here on business. My wife’s.”<br>“I am.”<br>“Well, you’ve had your drink, so we better get down to it. I’ve still got a full day’s work ahead of me, and it’s <-<-<-<three o’clock in the afternoon>->->->.”"
"The storm swept through all of Europe, raging through the night and on into the next day, and when Cromwell died at <-<-<-<three o’clock in the afternoon>->->-> it was still desolating the island."
"At <-<-<-<three o’clock precisely>->->-> I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned."
"And now it was <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->->. The Antichrist had been on Earth for fifteen hours, and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them."
"The city clocks had only just gone <-<-<-<three>->->->, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air."
"Dating from <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> yesterday. My perpetual influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before."
"Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have been impossible: eating <-<-<-<three-o’clock>->->->, after-dance suppers in impossible cafes, talking of every side of life with an air half of earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But he never realized how wide-spread it was until he saw the cities between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue."
The afternoon waned from the purging good of <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> to the golden beauty of four.
"With some difficulty, James battled his way past waves of scent, screeching voices and glossy black hair.<br>“What on earth is going on?” he asked when he reached the safety of his office.<br>Carlo shrugged. “It’s <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->->.”<br>“I’m aware of the time, Carlo. Why are there so many women outside?”<br>“They are the 𝘧𝘪𝘥𝘢𝘯𝘻𝘢𝘵𝘦. The women who want to marry Allied servicemen.”"
I gotta get uptown by <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->->.
"Remember, they shouted, ""battle at <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->-> sharp. There's no time to lose."""
"And the sound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave; which receded, and gathered itself together to fall once more, when she heard, distractedly, something fumbling, something scratching at the door. Who at this hour? <-<-<-<Three>->->->, good Heavens! Three already!"
"At <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->-> on the afternoon of that same day, he called on her. She held out her two hands, smiling in her usual charming, friendly way; and for a few seconds they looked deep into each other's eyes."
"At <-<-<-<three>->->-> on the Wednesday afternoon, that bit of the painting was completed."
"Ditched by the woman I loved, I exalted my suffering into a sign of greatness (lying collapsed on a bed at <-<-<-<three>->->-> in the afternoon), and hence protected myself from experiencing my grief as the outcome of what was at best a mundane romantic break-up. Chloe's departure may have killed me, but it had at least left me in glorious possession of the moral high ground. I was a martyr."
"He walks into the Hospital for Broken Things at <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->-> on Monday afternoon. That was the arrangement. If he came in after six o'clock, he was to head straight for the house in Sunset Park."
"I had a <-<-<-<three o’clock>->->-> class in psychology, the first meeting of the semester, and I suspected I was going to miss it. I was right. Victoria made a real ritual of the whole thing, clothes coming off with the masturbatory dalliance of a strip show, the covers rolling back periodically to show this patch of flesh or that, strategically revealed."
"It was <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->-> in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr. Casaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk, the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in their walks"
"Ladies bathed before noon, after their <-<-<-<three-o’clock>->->-> naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum."
"M. Madeleine usually came at <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->->, and as punctuality was kindness, he was punctual."
"On Wednesday at <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->->, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, seated in their dog-cart, set out for Vaubyessard, with a great trunk strapped on behind and a bonnet-box in front of the apron. Besides these Charles held a bandbox between his knees."
The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating <-<-<-<at three>->->-> in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling - a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension - becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.
"<-<-<-<Three o'clock>->->-> is the perfect time in Cham, because anything is possible. You can still ski, but also respectably start drinking, the shops have just reopened, the sun is still up. Three o'clock is never too late or too early."
"Today was the day Alex had appointed for her 'punishment'. I became increasingly nervous as the hour of <-<-<-<three o'clock>->->-> approached. I was alone in the house, and paced restlessly from room to room, glancing at the clocks in each of them."
"The sun was now setting. It was <-<-<-<about three>->->-> in the afternoon when Alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were; so she had made pretty good progress with it - for her. She would arrive some time or other, no doubt, but she was not a person who could be hurried."
"There'll be twenty pallets' worth by three o'clock tomorrow, see, comes a man's voice from the office down the hall, ""and if your truck isn't here at <-<-<-<one minute past three>->->->, then the lot'll be going to the Fine Fare depot in Aylesford."""
"It was <-<-<-<one minute past three>->->->. As he walked, he became aware of the echoing sound his feet made on the marble floor. It was then that he heard a voice say, “Do you wish to confess, my son?”"
"But after months of checking and rechecking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at <-<-<-<two minutes past three>->->-> Western time on 19 October 1995, had officially been recognized."
"I check Shingi's mobile phone - it says it's <-<-<-<3.03 pm>->->->. I get out of bed, open my suitcase to take clean socks out and the smell of Mother hit my nose and make me feel dizzy."
"He checked his watch: <-<-<-<3:04 P.M.>->->-> He banged on the door again, but still no one responded. Surely they would not deny him entry when he was only a couple of minutes late?"
He saw the clock in the town-hall tower standing at <-<-<-<four minutes past three>->->-> on that hot and windless late-July afternoon.
Woken at <-<-<-<1504>->->-> by Michelangelo hammering away with his chisel.
"Five minutes ago it was three o'clock, Murphy said. ""I can't be certain, but I theorize that it must now be about <-<-<-<three-oh-five>->->->.""<br>I folded my arms. ""I don't usually do stakeouts."""
"For one moment Ruth could see the bones of the bats standing out clearly, as if in an X-ray picture.<br>Then all the green turned black.<br>It was <-<-<-<3:05 P.M.>->->->"
"Ultimately, at <-<-<-<five minutes past three>->->-> that afternoon, Smith admitted the falsity of the Fort Scott tale.<br>""That was only something Dick told his family. So he could stay out overnight. Do some drinking."""
"The clock on the ""Lal Girja's"" tower stood at <-<-<-<six minutes past three>->->->."
"The next day was grey, threatening rain. He was there at <-<-<-<seven minutes past three>->->->. The clock on the church over the way pointed to it. They had arranged to be there at three fifteen. Therefore, if she had been there when he came, she would have been eight minutes before her time."
"The mist was thinning now and he could just discern the Grange itself - a substantial, dark shadow marked by blurs of lights from the windows. His watch showed that it was <-<-<-<eight minutes past three>->->->. So they would all be closeted now in solitary meditation waiting for the four o'clock summons to announce their final votes."
"A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at <-<-<-<3 hr 8 m p.m.>->->-> at Ascot (Greenwich time), the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m."
"“And now I must dash, Seb. I’m off to see my mother in Yorkshire, and if I don’t leave immediately I’ll miss the <-<-<-<3:09>->->-> to Huddersfield. Do give your mother my kindest regards and wish her luck for the trial.”"
On the next day he boarded the London train which reaches Hull at <-<-<-<3.09>->->->. At Paragon Station he soon singled out Beamish from Merriman's description.
"It was <-<-<-<ten after three>->->-> when Miles drove into the park. He saw the Binghams' black GMC pickup standing next to the pump. He pulled up beside it and almost before he came to a stop Beverly opened the door and got into the front seat with him. He thought at first that she had been crying, but what he took to be tears on her cheeks were raindrops."
"At <-<-<-<3:10 p.m.>->->->, the restaurant was still about two hours from opening, which was how Randy liked it for their visits. As they passed by the wooden benches and coat racks in the lobby, Eva liked to stop and look at a sepia-toned portrait of the owners, Jack Dougherty and Ishmael Mendoza, and a framed “Story of Lulu’s” that was meant to help pass the time for customers willing to tolerate a substantial wait."
"This time it was only the simple fact that the hands chanced to point to <-<-<-<3.10 pm>->->->, the precise moment at which all the clocks of London had stopped."
"When Virginia entered the tea room at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past three>->->->, Giles gasped. No one would have thought it possible that this elegant woman was over sixty."
"Heart rate one thirty-two, one thirty-one, one thirty, and dropping. She was walking south on Park Avenue in the rain. The time was now <-<-<-<eleven past three p.m.>->->->"
"At <-<-<-<twelve minutes past three>->->->, an announcement came over the loudspeaker. “All those involved in the Cartwright case, please make their way back in to court number four, as the jury is returning.”"
"Perhaps those three miles were nearer four, because when, tired, dusty, and heart-sick, he described the tower of the Congregational church above the leafless elms and maples of the village, the gilded hands pointed to <-<-<-<twelve minutes past three>->->->."
"The lift moved. It was <-<-<-<thirteen minutes past three>->->->. The bell gave out its ping. Two men stepped out of the lift, Alan Norman and another man. Tony Blair walked into the office."
"A signal sounded. ""There's the <-<-<-<3.14>->->-> up,"" said Perks. ""You lie low till she's through, and then we'll go up along to my place, and see if there's any of them strawberries ripe what I told you about."""
"I shall be back at exactly <-<-<-<THREE fourteen>->->->, for our hour of revery together, real sweet revery darling"
"A <-<-<-<quarter after three>->->->. There was time to check with the local morgues to see if they had turned up any likely John Does - who knew, my search might be over before the day's end - and then get bank to deposit my money and fire off a check to my landlord."
The boss had had something rather more spectacular than a bowel movement; at <-<-<-<three-fifteen>->->-> that day he had done something in his pants that was the equivalent of a shit A-bomb.
"Sixsmith next lines up for an airplane ticket. News of delays lulls him like a litany. He keeps a nervous eye out for sign of Seaboard’s agents coming to pick him up at this late hour. Finally, a ticket clerk waves him over.<br>“I have to get to London. Any destination in the United Kingdom, in fact. Any seat, any airline. I’ll pay in cash.”<br>“Not a 𝘱𝘳𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘳, sir.” The clerk’s tiredness shows through her makeup. “Earliest I can manage”—she consults a teleprinted sheet—""London Heathrow . . .. tomorrow afternoon, <-<-<-<three-fifteen>->->-> departure, Laker Skytrains, change at JFK."""
"Gordon was alone. He wandered back to the door. The strawberry-nosed man glanced over his shoulder, caught Gordon's eye, and moved off, foiled. He had been on the point of slipping Edgar Wallace into his pocket. The clock over the Prince of Wales struck a <-<-<-<quarter past three>->->->."
"I got out my old clothes. I put wool socks over my regular socks and took my time lacing up the boots. I made a couple of tuna sandwiches and some double-decker peanut-butter crackers. I filled my canteen and attached the hunting knife and the canteen to my belt. As I was going out the door, I decided to leave a note. So I wrote: ""Feeling better and going to Birch Creek. Back soon. R. <-<-<-<3:15>->->->."" That was about four hours from now."
"July 3: 5 3/4 hours. Little done today. Deepening lethargy, dragged myself over to the lab, nearly left the road twice. Concentrated enough to feed the zoo and get the log up to date. Read through the operating manuals Whitby left for the last time, decided on a delivery rate of 40 röntgens/min., target distance of 530 cm. Everything is ready now. Woke 11:05. To sleep <-<-<-<3:15>->->->."
The Nimrod rendezvoused with the light aircraft at <-<-<-<1516>->->-> GMT.
Romanov checked the clock on the wall: <-<-<-<three-seventeen>->->->. He couldn’t believe he would need close to two hours to find out what was in the five boxes. The two Herr Bischoffs bowed and left.
"“You can take the <-<-<-<3:17>->->-> to Peterborough, where you’ll have to change and catch the 4:09 for Doncaster, then change again. You’ll arrive in Hull at 6:32.”"
"From the kitchen came the rackety-banging of the alarm-clock, proving that, as the clock was set to ring at six, Peter had found a mother for the fatherless children at just <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past three>->->->."
"<-<-<-<3:18 P.M.>->->-><br>Vance cocked the Pakistani's Uzi and trained it on the door, not sure what to do. The fear was that he might inadvertently kill a friendly. Hostage situations always presented that harrowing possibility. Quick identifications and quick decisions were what made good antiterrorist teams. He was afraid he had neither skill. He wasn't even that great a shot."
The graphic film is already wrinkling: the eagle has a broken wing; the hour hand is kinked. It is <-<-<-<eighteen minutes past three>->->->.
"At <-<-<-<nineteen minutes past three>->->-> Cecily Thorogood, still self-possessed, but no longer very prettily clad, was submerged in the chilly Atlantic up to her shoulders and clinging to the life-line of an upturned jolly-boat."
"James jammed his trilby over his ears, looked the other way and passed the time by chatting to Sam O’Flaherty about the <-<-<-<3:20>->->->, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes."
"He checked his watch. Only <-<-<-<3:20>->->->, but that was close enough for government work. Claudette Albertson surprised him. “No, it’s Mr. Hayes, right down here on the first floor with us.”<br>“Are you sure?” Dan had played a game of checkers with Charlie Hayes just that afternoon, and for a man with acute myelogenous leukemia, he’d seemed as lively as a cricket."
"When the phone rang at <-<-<-<three twenty>->->-> I was sprawled out on the tatami, starting at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December 1971 spotlight."
"At <-<-<-<twenty minutes past three>->->-> on Monday, 26 January 1948, in Tokyo, and I am drinking and I am drinking and I am drinking and I am drinking and I am drinking and I am drinking and I am drinking and I am drinking and I am drinking."
"<-<-<-<3:21 P.M.>->->-><br>""Let them go,"" Ramirez said. ""We have what we need."" He bent down and picked up the box."
"Ruth finally walked through the door at <-<-<-<3:22 P.M.>->->-> “Any messages?” she asked the receptionist.<br>“No,” replied the girl, “but there is a lady waiting to see you.”"
"<-<-<-<3:22 P.M.>->->-><br>As Stone Aimes stepped off the elevator on the sixth floor, his mind was running through his options. This phone call had to be about Winston Bartlett. He was going to step up the pressure."
"<-<-<-<Three twenty-three>->->->! Is that all? Doesn't time - no, I've already said that, thought that. I sit and watch the seconds change on the watch. I used to have a limited edition Rolex worth the price of a new car but I lost it."
"The organist, in his incredulous relief, made a horrible mess of the first bars of the wedding march. It was <-<-<-<twenty-four minutes past three>->->-> before Jimmy mouthed the first sentence of the day that even he was unable to shorten.<br>""I do,"" he said."
"Hmm, let's see. It's a three-line rail-fence, a, d, g...d-a-r-l...Got it: 'Darling Hepzibah'<br>Hepzibah? What kind of name is that?<br>'Will meet you Reading Sunday <-<-<-<15.25>->->-> train Didcot-Reading.' Reading you all right, you idiots."
"The next afternoon Mr. Underhill finished at the office early and took the three o'clock train, arriving out in Green Town at <-<-<-<three twenty-five>->->->, in plenty of time to drink in the brisk rays of the autumnal sun."
"It was almost <-<-<-<15.26>->->-> so I sent a two-word message to Chris - ""All OK"" - then started walking purposefully towards the nearest Portakabin, trying not to dwell too much on the insanity of what I was doing."
"At <-<-<-<three twenty-seven P.M.>->->->, the precise minute Albert had been born in 1907, the old man, surrounded by his five children, eleven grandchildren, and nineteen great-grandchildren, thrust a silver-handled knife into a three-tier cake."
"And she rang the Reverend Peters and he came into school at <-<-<-<3.27 p.m.>->->-> and he said, ""So, young man, are we ready to roll?"""
"“<-<-<-<Three twenty-eight>->->->!” he cried, excitedly. “Didn’t I tell you! Who says we can’t keep time up here! She’ll run her plank ashore at three forty-five to the dot!”"
"Good heavens! she said, ""it's <-<-<-<nearly half-past three>->->->. I must fly. Don't forget about the funeral service,"" she added, as she put on her coat. ""The tapers, the black coffin in the middle of the aisle, the nuns in their white-winged coifs, the gloomy chanting, and the poor cowering creature without any teeth, her face all caved in like an old woman's, wondering whether she wasn't really and in fact dead - wondering whether she wasn't already in hell. Goodbye."""
"Wednesday <-<-<-<3:29 P.M.>->->-><br>""Michael, you look marvelous. It's so good to see you again. I really mean that. The years have treated you well."" Eva Borodin leaned back against the gray fabric of the Saab's headrest and appraised him."
"<-<-<-<3:29 P.M.>->->-><br>Events were getting serious enough that the operation had been moved down to the Situation Room, in the White House basement."
"“They will vote in favor,” Eliza said, her voice full of certainty.<br>“Yes. Technically, the Congregation could reject a recommendation of the Council of High Stewards, but in reality, it is unlikely. In fact, I have already booked studio time for <-<-<-<three-thirty>->->-> to record a message for the worlds. I have been preparing that here.”"
"“<-<-<-<Half past three>->->->. Tea time,” said Mary Poppins, and she wheeled the perambulator round and shut her mouth tight again as though it were a trap door. She did not say another word all the way home."
"At first, the change of scene appeared to be working. He managed to digest the roast beef sandwich and asparagus salad he ordered for lunch. At <-<-<-<3:30>->->-> he met a friend’s girlfriend in the hotel tearoom, where he sent his stomach a piece of cherry pie and black coffee, which also stayed down."
"There wasn’t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s Birthday, or dentist, <-<-<-<half-past three>->->->."
They found two unlocked bicycles in Holder Court and rode out about <-<-<-<half-past three>->->-> along the Lawrenceville Road.
"Before I am rrroasting the alarm-clock, I am setting it to go off, not at nine o'clock the next morning, but at <-<-<-<half-past thrrree>->->-> the next afternoon. Vhich means half-past thrrree this afternoon. And that, she said, glancing at her wrist-watch, ""is in prrree-cisely seven minutes' time!"""
<-<-<-<3.30 p.m.>->->-> Catch school bus home
"I must have completed my packing with time to spare, for when the knock came on my door at <-<-<-<half past three>->->-> precisely, I had been sitting in my chair waiting for a good while. I opened the door to a young Chinese man, perhaps not even twenty, dressed in a gown, his hat in his hand."
"At <-<-<-<three-thirty one and a half>->->-> by my wrist watch--the only piece of jewelry, by the way, you've left me--I received, Lord Tawdry, this communication from the hospital cot of the Honorable Bertram Butternut!"
"At <-<-<-<3:32>->->-> precisely, I noticed Kaitlyn striding confidently past the Wok House. She saw me the moment I raised my hand, flashed her very white and newly straightened teeth at me, and headed over."
"Jon stepped out of the Peugeot and headed inside the Shrine of the Book, his heart throbbing a pulse he could feel down to his fingertips. A walk down the ramp brought him to the office of the director, Dov Sonnenfeld. He looked at his watch: <-<-<-<3:33 PM>->->->."
"I picked up my briefcase, glancing at my watch again as I did so. <-<-<-<Three thirty-three>->->->."
"In fact, it wasn’t until the final result had been declared in Mulgelrie at <-<-<-<3:34 p.m.>->->-> on the day after the election that the nation began to prepare itself for the first Labor government since Clement Attlee’s thirteen years before."
It was <-<-<-<15:34>->->-> now and the sleepiness felt like lead inside him.
"Sasha was sitting in the corner of the railway carriage when the <-<-<-<3:35>->->-> shunted out of Southampton station on its way to London. He stared out of the window but didn’t speak, because his mind was far away in his homeland. He was beginning to wonder if they’d made a terrible mistake."
"By <-<-<-<three-thirty-five>->->-> business really winds down. I have already sold my ladderback chairs and my Scottish cardigans. I'm not even sure now why I've sold all these things, except perhaps so as not to be left out of this giant insult to one's life that is a yard sale, this general project of getting rid quick."
"If Me flashed a little crazy after a restless night of smoking & prowling the darkened house with owl-eyes alert to suspicious noises outside & on the roof, it didn’t inevitably mean she’d still be in such a state when the schoolbus deposited Wolfie back home at <-<-<-<3:35 P.M.>->->->"
A strange thought crossed his mind. He must remember to tell Clare that the top of Everest was about the same size as their dining-room table. George checked his watch: <-<-<-<3:36 P.M.>->->->
Meanwhile a girl was standing in an airport concourse. A big clock suspended from the ceiling said it was <-<-<-<twenty-four minutes to four>->->->.
"The explosion was now officially designated an ""Act of God"". But, thought Dirk, what god? And why? What god would be hanging around Terminal Two of Heathrow Airport trying to catch the <-<-<-<15.37>->->-> flight to Oslo?"
Mendez took a marker and added to the line for the day Karly Vickers disappeared: <-<-<-<15:38>->->-> traffic ticket issued by F. Farman.
"I lived two lives in late 1965 and early 1963, one in Dallas and one in Jodie. They came together at <-<-<-<three thirty-nine>->->-> in the afternoon of April 10."
Why had nobody else arrived? Could he be too early? But no! They had said half past three and it was at least <-<-<-<twenty to four>->->->. He hastened towards the gate.
"At <-<-<-<three-forty>->->->, Cliff called to report that Dilworth and his lady friend were sitting on the deck of the Amazing Grace, eating fruit and sipping wine, reminiscing a lot, laughing a little. “From what we can pick up with directional microphones and from what we can see, I’d say they don’t have any intention of going anywhere. Except maybe to bed. They sure do seem to be a randy old pair.”<br>“Stay with them,” Lem said. “I don’t trust him.”"
"At <-<-<-<15:41>->->-> GMT, the Cessna's engine began to cut out and the plane - presumably out of fuel - began to lose altitude"
Montoya gave his computer an order and the feed blurred to <-<-<-<3:42 p.m.>->->-> Our vehicle came to the driveway three minutes later.

The armed response team hastily assembled from Strängnäs arrived at Bjurman's summer cabin at <-<-<-<3.44 p.m.>->->->
"Still, with that many acres of old vehicles, his chances looked pretty good. He glanced at his watch - <-<-<-<3:45 P.M.>->->->"
"It’s <-<-<-<3:45 p.m.>->->-> and dark outside as I walk down the quiet hospice corridor, looking for Luke O’Leary’s room. I find it - his name card is in the holder outside the door, and the door is ajar. I hesitate. Afraid. There’s a small flow from inside. A curtain hangs partially across the doorway. I easy back the curtain and enter quietly."
"I opened my notebook, flipped almost to the end before I found a blank page, and wrote October 5th, <-<-<-<3:45 pm>->->->, Dunning to Longview Cem, puts flowers on parents’ (?) graves. Rain."
"“Well, it’s already <-<-<-<three forty-five>->->->. You’ll never make it.”<br>“Is the backup bad?”<br>“Looks like a major accident up ahead. This is no ordinary traffic jam. We’ve hardly moved for quite a while.”"
"One meal is enough now, topped up with a glucose shot. Sleep is still 'black', completely unrefreshing. Last night I took a 16 mm. film of the first three hours, screened it this morning at the lab. The first true-horror movie. I looked like a half-animated corpse. Woke 10:25. To sleep <-<-<-<3:45>->->->."
I authorize you to leave this room at <-<-<-<fourteen minutes to four>->->->. Not a moment before fourteen minutes to four. . . Is it understood?
<-<-<-<Three forty-seven>->->->. He estimated that he still had at least another twenty minutes before the bridge party would begin to break up.
"One day, the 30th of September, at <-<-<-<3:47 P.M.>->->->, a telegram, transmitted by cable from Valentia (Ireland) to Newfoundland and the American Mainland, arrived at the address of President Barbicane."

<-<-<-<3.49 p.m.>->->-> Get off school bus at home
But there were more bad things than good things. And one of them was that Mother didn't get back from work til 5.30 pm so I had to go to Father's house between <-<-<-<3.49 pm>->->-> and 5.30 pm because I wasn't allowed to be on my own and Mother said I didn't have a choice so I pushed the bed against the door in case Father tried to come in.
"Romanov paced up and down the small anteroom impatiently, but the secretary did not return until the hands on the clock were in a straight line. At <-<-<-<three-fifty>->->->, Romanov was ushered into the chairman’s room."

"Date of the telegram, Rome, November 24, ten minutes before twenty-three o'clock. The telegram seems to say, ""The Sovereigns and the Royal Children expect themselves at Rome tomorrow at <-<-<-<fifty-one minutes after fifteen o'clock>->->->."""
"He came to a curve, and there was the lay-by, just where McCready had said it would be. He checked his watch; <-<-<-<eight minutes to four>->->->. The road was empty."
It was like the clouds lifting away from the sun. Jodie glanced at Reacher. He glanced at the clock. <-<-<-<Seven minutes to four>->->->. Less than three hours to go.
"We were visible in the lower part of the frame of the feed from the east side of Eleventh at <-<-<-<3:54 p.m.>->->-> Two minutes passed and there it was a placard with the SHOOT THE RICH graffiti on it held by a guy in an LA Dodgers cap, dark sunglasses, a khaki-green shirt, and a black bandana around his neck."
<-<-<-<3.55 p.m.>->->-> Give Toby food and water
"<-<-<-<Four minutes to four>->->->. Newman sighed again, lost in thought."
"The clerk had stepped into the hall, and when he came leisurely in at <-<-<-<three minutes to four>->->->, Caxton discovered that he had written his petition on the back of a blank marriage liscense."
"Punctuality is an obsession with the Japanese, so Anna was not surprised when a smartly dressed lady appeared at <-<-<-<two minutes to four>->->->, bowed, and invited Anna to follow her. She too looked at the wooden box, but showed no reaction other than to ask, “Would you like it to be taken to the chairman’s office?”"
"A hum of tolling bells makes itself heard, but not sharply. At <-<-<-<three-fifty-eight>->->-> a waiting interval. Presently a long procession of gentlemen in evening dress comes in sight and approaches until it is near to the square, then falls back against the wall of soldiers at the sidewalk, and the white shirt-fronts show like snowflakes and are very conspicuous where so much warm color is all about."
"He was walking through the gate in the Gilson hedge at <-<-<-<one minute to four>->->->.<br>But he had reached Queen Anne Hill at three. For an hour he had walked the crest road, staring at the steamers below, alternately gripping his hands with desire of Claire, and timorously finally deciding that he wouldn't go to her house--wouldn't ever see her again."
"As it lacked <-<-<-<one minute to four>->->-> when Hedworth Westerling, chief of staff in name as well as power now, alighted from the gray automobile that turned in at the Galland drive, the chauffeur thought well enough of himself to forget the crush of supplies and ambulances that had delayed His Excellency's car for at least ninety seconds in the main street of the town."
"It was <-<-<-<close upon four>->->-> before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he."
"<-<-<-<Towards four o'clock>->->-> the condition of the English army was serious. The Prince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing, Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid, shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: ""Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!"""
He looked at his watch: it was <-<-<-<nearly 4>->->->. He helped Delphine to her feet and led her down a passage to a rear door that gave on to the hospital garden.
"At <-<-<-<four>->->-> you can go into the greenhouse and get two dozen daffodils to remind us of spring, that there is a spring."
"It was <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->, and they had another hour of daylight left before it would be time to quit. Charlie wanted to shoot his father’s gun as promised, though not at a duck, but he didn’t know if he dared ask."
"I followed his gaze to the mantelpiece. The clock had stopped at <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->.<br>“Mon ami, someone has tampered with it. It had still three days to run. It is an eight-day clock, you comprehend?”<br>“But what should they want to do that for? Some idea of a false scent by making the crime appear to have taken place at four o’clock?”"
"It’s a delusional painter who finishes a canvas at two o’clock and expects radical societal transformation by <-<-<-<four>->->->. Even when artists write manifestos, they are (hopefully) aware that their exigent tone is, finally, borrowed, only echoing and mimicking the urgency of the guerrilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests, rather than truly enacting it. The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art."
"“If ever you are passing my way,"" said Bilbo, ""don’t wait to knock! Tea is at <-<-<-<four>->->->, but any of you are welcome at any time.”"
"At <-<-<-<four clock>->->->, Eva unspools the finished Harvard reference from her typewriter, folds it neatly, and places it inside a good cream envelope. Then she shrugs on her coat, checks her handbag for car keys, purse, compact."
"But, with a throb of undiluted angst, I realized that I’d felt such restlessness and emptiness in the past. Often. It usually kicked in at about <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> on a Sunday, but had arrived slightly late today, no doubt still on New York time."
"It was <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> before we finally got away. Now, for some reason, it was Charles and Camilla who weren’t speaking. They’d fought about something - I’d seen them arguing in the yard - and all the way home, in the back seat, they sat side by side and stared straight ahead, their arms folded across their chests in what I am sure they did not realize was a comically identical fashion."
"Sammy woke, flushed and disoriented, around <-<-<-<four>->->-> that afternoon. We made our tea together. I put on bread to toast and I put soup in a pan to heat. Outside the weather worsened, tumbling up into a spring storm, all squalls and blusters. Sammy rode on my hip and we made a game of it as I walked around the house checking the window fixings and drawing the curtains, even though it wasn’t yet properly dark."
"They stood at the iron rail, not talking among themselves, just watching. And taking long slow deep breaths, like tourists from the Midwest standing for the first time on Pemaquid Point or Quoddy Head in Maine, breathing deep of the fresh sea air. As a sign of respect, Rose took off her tophat and held it by her side.<br>At <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> they trooped back to their encampment in the parking lot, invigorated. They would return the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. They would return until the good steam was exhausted, and then they would move on."
"“Good morning, Dr. Tuttle,” I said.<br>“It’s <-<-<-<four in the afternoon>->->->,” she said. “I’m sorry it took me so long to return your call. My cats had an emergency. Are you feeling better? The symptoms you described in your message, frankly, puzzle me.”"
"Well, it had become pretty clear I wasn’t going to be able to catch E. on her own. She never appeared at the belfry at <-<-<-<four P.M.>->->-> That my communiqués were being intercepted was the only explanation that occurred to me."
"I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day."
"“At <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter."
"It was nearly <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform."
"She lay down at <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->, not expecting to sleep a wink, but her healing body had its own priorities. She went under almost instantly, and when she woke to the insistent 𝘥𝘢𝘩-𝘥𝘢𝘩-𝘥𝘢𝘩 of her bedside clock, she was glad she had set the alarm. Outside, a gusty October breeze was combing leaves from the trees and sending them across her backyard in colorful skitters. The light had gone that strange and depthless gold which seems the exclusive property of late-fall afternoons in New England."
"So then my father refused to eat Christmas lunch with us, which my mother finally served at around <-<-<-<four p.m.>->->->, by which time we were all starving and quite drunk, and, well … it was a very dysfunctional Christmas Day."
"That’s enough to begin with, Humpty Dumpty interrupted: ""there are plenty of hard words there. 'Brillig' means <-<-<-<four o’clock in the afternoon>->->-> — the time when you begin broiling things for dinner."""
"Please join us on Sunday February 2nd 2003 from <-<-<-<4 p.m.>->->-> at the Hoxton Gallery, London N1, to preview a new exhibition of faecal paintings by Catherine Leidensteiner."
"Billy Bibbit and his girl mentioned that it was after <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> and, if it was all right, if people didn’t mind, they’d like to have Mr. Turkle unlock the Seclusion Room."
"“If you should have no objection to receive me into your house,<br>I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family,<br>Monday, November 18th, by <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->, and shall probably trespass<br>on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I can<br>do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting<br>to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.”"
"Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> dinner, the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again."
"“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->,” was Mrs. Weston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for her."
The afternoon waned from the purging good of three o’clock to the golden beauty of <-<-<-<four>->->->.
"... when they all sat down to table at <-<-<-<four o'clock>->->->, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one of the happiest of men."

"As he turned off towards the fishing village of Cellardyke, the familiar pips announced the <-<-<-<four o'clock>->->-> news. The comforting voice of the newsreader began the bulletin. ""The convicted serial killer and former TV chat show host Jacko Vance has begun his appeal against conviction."""
Charmian woke at <-<-<-<four>->->-> and sensed the emptiness of the house.
"Djerzinski arrived punctually at <-<-<-<four>->->-> o’clock. Desplechin had asked to see him. The case was intriguing. Certainly, it was common for a researcher to take a year’s sabbatical to work in Norway or Japan, or one of those sinister countries where middle aged people committed suicide en masse."
"<-<-<-<Four o'clock>->->->: wedge-shaped gardens lie Under a cavernous, a wind-picked sky."
"<-<-<-<Four o'clock>->->->: when time in the city quivers on its axis - the day not yet spent, the wheels of evening just beginning to turn. The handover hour, was how Marius liked to think of it."
"<-<-<-<Four o’clock>->->-> has just struck. Good! Arrangement, revision, reading from four to five. Short snooze of restoration for myself, from five to six. Affair of agent and sealed letter from seven to eight. At eight, en route."
"He played for twenty-two days, just as he said he would. Every day at <-<-<-<four o'clock>->->-> in the afternoon, regardless of how much fighting was going on around him."
"Her eyes caught the kryptonite glow of the digital clock on the front of the microwave. Honest and true, the numbers spelled out the time although she, for a moment, found its calculation to be somehow erroneous. It was <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->-> in the afternoon."
"I doubt whether anyone was commissioned to send the news along the actual telegraph, and yet Mrs. Proudie knew it before <-<-<-<four o'clock>->->->. But she did not know it quite accurately.<br>""Bishop"", she said, standing at her husband's study door. ""They have committed that man to gaol. There was no help for them unless they had forsworn themselves."""
"I only found out much later that those flowers were called <-<-<-<Four o’clock>->->->, and were not magic at all. The magic was in the seed, waiting to be watered and cared for, the real magic was life."
"In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn’t cope with, and that terrible listlessness that starts to set in about 2.55, when you know you’ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to <-<-<-<four o’clock>->->->, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul."
In the four thousand rooms of the Centre the four thousand electric clocks simultaneously <-<-<-<struck four>->->->. Discarnate voices called from the trumpet mouths.
"It was my turn to cook the evening meal so I didn't linger in the common room. It was exactly <-<-<-<4 o'clock>->->-> as I made my way out of the building, and doors opened behind and before me, discharging salvos of vocal babble and the noise of chair-legs scraping on wooden floors."
"The horrifying R.N. wipes Gately's face off as best she can with her hand and says she'll try to fit him in for a sponge bath before she goes off shift at <-<-<-<1600h.>->->->, at which Gately goes rigid with dread."
"<-<-<-<A little after four o'clock>->->->, Pippa meandered over to Dot's house carrying a bottle of wine she had been keeping in reserve and wondering if she could possibly be pregnant in spite of the vestigial coil still lodged in her uterus like astronaut litter abandoned on the moon."
"Light is coming in through the curtains. Suddenly the digits on the clock radio look like a year. <-<-<-<1601>->->->. I woke up a bit early, don't have to be born for another 400 years."
"I'd just looked up at the clock, to make sure time wasn't getting away from me, when I heard the shot. It was <-<-<-<two minutes after four>->->->. I didn't know what to do."

"Krantz didn’t stir for the next two hours, aware that two of the guards would be waiting impatiently to accompany her to the bathroom and collect their nightly stipend. But the timing had to suit her. She would cater for their needs at <-<-<-<four minutes past four>->->->, not before, when one would receive forty dollars, and he would make sure that the other got a packet of Benson & Hedges."
"At <-<-<-<four past four>->->-> he was aware of a rustling train's rush down the steps, and now was like a man with his neck on the block, awaiting the axe."
"I was standing at the top of the long flight, overlooking the red brick buildings that walled the snow-filled quad and preparing to catch the trolley back to the asylum, when a tall young man with a rather ugly and bespectacled, but intelligent face, came up and said, ""Could you please tell me the time?""<br>I glanced at my watch. ""<-<-<-<Five past four>->->->."""
"IT was exactly <-<-<-<five minutes past four>->->-> as Mr. Robert Audley stepped out upon the platform at Shoreditch, and waited placidly … it took a long while to make matters agreeable to all claimants, and even the barrister's seraphic indifference to mundane affairs nearly gave way."
"At <-<-<-<six minutes after four>->->->, Benny's Cadillac pulled up in front of Mr. Botelia's store, and Benny's mother stepped out of the car with Penelope, who was gnawing on the tip of an ice cream cone."
"At <-<-<-<seven minutes past four>->->-> radio silence was broken with the five words, “Shoplifter apprehended, repeat Shoplifter apprehended.”"
"But he released him immediately because the ladder slipped from under his feet and for an instant he was suspended in air and then he realised that he had died without Communion, without time to repent of anything or to say goodbye to anyone, at <-<-<-<seven minutes after four>->->-> on Pentecost Sunday."
"At <-<-<-<eight minutes past four>->->->, the jury filed back into their places and this time Alex noted that their expressions had changed from blank to bemused. Mr. Justice Sackville had no choice but to send them home for a second night."
"It was <-<-<-<eight minutes after four>->->->. I still don't have a plan. Maybe the guys in the Nova, maybe they had a plan."
"“You can take the 3:17 to Peterborough, where you’ll have to change and catch the <-<-<-<4:09>->->-> for Doncaster, then change again. You’ll arrive in Hull at 6:32.”"

"This Saturday he had left the greetings to Father Martin, but at <-<-<-<ten past four>->->-> he thought it would be courteous to put in an appearance."
<-<-<-<1610h.>->->-> E.T.A Weight room. Freestyle circuits. The clank and click of various resistance systems.
"She looks at the clock. She's in the kitchen. A minute left. She waits. It's <-<-<-<ten-past four>->->->. She picks up the eclair. She licks the cream out of it. She watches herself.It's fuckin' stupid. But. She bites into the chocolate, and the pastry that's been softened by the cream. Jack's not home yet. Leannes's at work. Paula will be leaving, herself, in a bit. She's a year off the drink. Exactly a year. She looks at the clock. A year and a minute."
"The change came at <-<-<-<four-ten>->->->. Lying on the sand, the woman in the black suit saw it coming and relaxed."
<-<-<-<4:11 P.M.>->->-> Thurs. A Huey helicopter flies east overhead as the last of the U.S. Marines make ready to leave the beach; a buzzard dangles in the thermals closer over the town.
"At <-<-<-<eleven minutes past four>->->->, the first bus left the car park, drove up the ramp, and out onto the high street."

"Then at <-<-<-<4.14 pm>->->-> on March 12 I moved behind zinc-zirconium-not-to-be-revealed-compounds protecting me in this hill, and God have mercy but the struggle is just exchanged for the next one, which is exhausting me further as I say, to separate the true from the false."
"Downstairs, the clock was striking <-<-<-<four-fifteen>->->->. They stopped for a moment in the kitchen so that she could look around. “Just when I left,” he said, nodding at the calendar by the refrigerator. “You know how careful Mom is about crossing off the days.” He glanced at her. “I’m sorry about the time you lost.”"
"<-<-<-<4:15 P.M.>->->-><br>Viewed through the window of the Purple Line train, the southbound Howard stop on the El was crowded—but less so than the northbound side, clustered with the first bloom of suburban commuters, weary from their early mornings and afternoon caffeine and blood sugar crashes."
I remember the dread with which I at <-<-<-<quarter past four>->->-><br>Let go with a bang behind me our house front door
"It is only a <-<-<-<quarter past four>->->->, (shewing his watch) and you are not now in Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at Northanger must be enough."
Must have the phone disconnected. Some contractor keeps calling me up about payment for 50 bags of cement he claims I collected ten days ago. Says he helped me load them onto a truck himself. I did drive Whitby's pick-up into town but only to get some lead screening. What does he think I'd do with all that cement? Just the sort of irritating thing you don't expect to hang over your final exit. (Moral: don't try too hard to forget Eniwetok.) Woke 9:40. To sleep <-<-<-<4:15>->->->.
"On the tenth day of October at <-<-<-<quarter past four>->->-> in the afternoon with a dry hot wind blowing through the passes Maria found herself in Baker. She had never meant to go as far as Baker, had started out that day as every day, her only destination the freeway. But she had driven out the San Bernardino and up the Barstow and instead of turning back at Barstow (she had been out that far before but never that late in the day, it was past time to navigate back, she was Out too far too late, the rhythm was lost) she kept driving."
"The sun had begun to sink in the west, and the shadow of an oak branch had crept across my knees. My watch said it was <-<-<-<4.15>->->->."
"<-<-<-<4.16 pm>->->-> The terrace outside the bar is packed, and Igor feels proud of his ability to plan things, because even though he's never been to Cannes before, he had foreseen precisely this situation and reserved a table."
"Apparently the great Percy has no sense of humour, for at <-<-<-<four-seventeen>->->-> he got tired of it, and hit Skinner crisply in the right eyeball, blacking the same as per illustration."
"In the next instant she was running toward her house, unmindful of the bags she had dropped, seeing only the police cars, knowing as she glanced down at her watch and saw that it was <-<-<-<seventeen minutes after four>->->->, that for her time had stopped."
<-<-<-<4.18 p.m.>->->-> Put Toby into his cage
Jessica [<-<-<-<4:19 PM>->->->] Don't tease me like that. I haven't been to a play in years. Charles [4:19 PM] Then it'll be my treat. You and the hubby can have big fun on me.
"“So, it was routinely tracked every fifty minutes. The last reported sighting was at <-<-<-<4:20 p.m.>->->-> Central Menaya time. It was still coming sunward and nearly at the point of closest approach to Farholme - estimated to be at one hundred thousand kilometers out - but was still behaving itself."""
<-<-<-<4.20 p.m.>->->-> Watch television or a video
"Hence it happened that he shouted out the hour, which was <-<-<-<twenty past four>->->->, in his big voice through the growing twilight; and somehow the loudness of it made it seem like the proclamation of something tremendous."
"At <-<-<-<twenty minutes past four>->->-> - or, to put it another, blunter way, an hour and twenty minutes past what seemed to be all reasonable hope - the unmarried bride, her head down, a parent stationed on either side of her, was helped out of the building."
"<-<-<-<4.21 pm>->->-><br>As they started on, Doug picked up a twig and after rubbing it off, started to move one end of it inside his mouth.<br>""What are you doing?"" Bob asked.<br>""Brushing my teeth, nature style,"" Doug answered.<br>Bob grunted, smiling slightly. ""I'll use my toothbrush,"" he said."
"Monday, <-<-<-<4.22 pm>->->-> Washington, D.C. Paul Hood took his daily late-afternoon look at the list of names on his computer monitor."
"They were hurrying west, trying to reach the river before sunset. The warming-related ""adjustments"" to Earth's orbit had shortened the winter days, so that now, in January, sunset was taking place at <-<-<-<4.23>->->->."
"<-<-<-<16:23 CET>->->-><br>After stowing their bags in the sleeping quarters below, the two new itinerant deckhands reported for duty on the main deck."
Mike winked at Ashley and continued with the remaining greetings and hugs and handshakes. The time was <-<-<-<4:24>->->->. Six hours to go. The minutes seemed to just melt away.
"He jumped off at St. Paul’s and, although he walked slowly, he was standing outside Kaufman’s bank on Cheapside by <-<-<-<4:25>->->->."
"“You will appear a few minutes after 4:20, Jean-Pierre, and then you, James, about <-<-<-<4:25 P.M.>->->-> But keep exactly to the same routine, act as if the meeting had taken place, as originally planned, at the Garden Party and we had all walked over to the Clarendon together.”"
I groan audibly. It’s <-<-<-<4:25 p.m.>->->-> — I can sneak out and say I didn’t see the email.
"It seemed all wrong to have thought of such a thing. She thought, ""I don't know him. Nor does he know me. Nor ever shall we.” She put her bare hand in the sun, where the wind would weather it. It was <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes after four>->->->."
"Still no sign of Juliet. Patricia gave a surreptitious glance at her watch; <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past four>->->-> - no! nearly twenty-eight past - Oh, hurry up, Juliet, hurry up, do!"
"Same day: <-<-<-<4.28 pm>->->->- Right turn at the second bus stop after the gas station. I stopped the car at the first ward post office and inquired at the corner tobacconists. Mr. M's house was the one to the right of the post office, visible diagonally in front of me."
"October 21, 2007, <-<-<-<4:29 pm>->->->. The phone was red. And what William hated most about it, besides the fact that it was inconveniently mounted on a wall in a tight corner (and at a strange angle), was that when it rang it was so gratingly loud that you could actually see the cherry receiver quavering as you picked it up."
"But I believe,” he pulled out his watch, “I can spend an hour with you. It’s <-<-<-<half-past four>->->-> now. If only I’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry officer, a photographer, a journalist … I am nothing, no specialty, and sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me something new.”"
"At <-<-<-<4:30>->->-> Gunther came back to House Berg with his arms full of yellow daffodils. Frau Julia was Frau Julia again, and she received both him and the daffodils with open arms."
"The local police wouldn't relish being called out at <-<-<-<4:30>->->-> on Christmas Eve, and if this was some kind of hoax he preferred not to be an active participant."
"“I won’t go in,” she says. “I’ll meet you on the steps at <-<-<-<four-thirty>->->->. We can take the girls to Murray’s for a sundae or something.”<br>He seems relieved. “Right,” he says.<br>“Tell the children to enjoy themselves.”"
"Jonas rolls painfully out of the hammock, his aching lower back stiff and swollen, in desperate need of a chiropractor. He checks his watch. <-<-<-<Four thirty>->->->…but is it a.m. or p.m.?"
"Sometimes I wonder what happened to the girl—the thought usually pops into my mind when I’m facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up, did she disappear forever, sucked into the <-<-<-<four thirty p.m.>->->-> shadows? Was I partly to blame?<br>I want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. That’s why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd."
"At <-<-<-<four-thirty>->->-> I dash out of the hotel, resolved to make a last-minute stab at it. Just as I turn the corner I brush against Walter Pach. Since he doesn’t recognize me, and since I have nothing to say to him, I make no attempt to arrest him. Later, when I am stretching my legs in the Tuileries his figure reverts to mind."
"A server is woken at hour <-<-<-<four-thirty>->->-> by stimulin in the airflow, then yellow-up in our dormroom. After a minute in the hygiener and steamer, we put on fresh uniforms before filing into the restaurant."
"This afternoon everything is matching up. When the swing shift comes on duty the clock says <-<-<-<four-thirty>->->->, just like it should."
"I looked at the clock. It was <-<-<-<half-past four>->->->. “Had no idea what hour it was,” Brett said. “I say, can a chap sit down? Don’t be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here.”"
"At <-<-<-<four-thirty>->->-> that afternoon in late January when I stepped into the parlour with Boo, my dog, Hutch was in his favourite armchair, scowling at the television, which he had muted."

"She hung up on me at first, then asked me whether I made a point of behaving like a 'small-time suburban punk' with women I had slept with. But after apologies, insults, laughter, and tears, Romeo and Juliet were to be seen together later that afternoon, mushily holding hands in the dark at a <-<-<-<four-thirty>->->-> screening of L ove and Death at the National Film Theatre. Happy endings – for now at least."
"From: Renee Greene – August 5, 2011 – <-<-<-<4:31 PM>->->-> To: Shelley Manning Subject: Re: All Access What should I be worried about, then? JUST KIDDING. You're right. Well, I gotta run, my groupie friend. I actually have REAL work to do. I'll talk to you tonight."
"<-<-<-<4.32 pm>->->->. Now the eight Marines next to us leave their emplacement and file quickly past, the last saying, ""Go! Go! Go!"" They break into a run."
"At <-<-<-<4.33 pm>->->->, a short bald man puffing on a cigar arrived at the library. He approached a huge cabinet storing thousands of alphabetically arranged cards and slid a drawer out. The tips of his fingers were bandaged."

"A bedroom stocked with all the ordinary, usual things. There was a wardrobe in the corner. A bedside table with a collection of water glasses of varying ages and an alarm clock with red digital numbers- <-<-<-<4.34 p.m.>->->->"
"“The plane you require does not leave Sheremetyevo Airport until <-<-<-<four thirty-five>->->->.

"The Voice shut itself off with a click, and then reopened conversation by announcing the arrival at Platform 9 of the <-<-<-<4.35>->->-> from Birmingham and Wolverhampton."
"They watched their friend through the glass cover; the heaving of the chest became less and less, the breathing lower and lower, while a purple hue settled upon his body. At <-<-<-<thirty-six minutes past four>->->->, the last division of the wheel had been reached."
"It was <-<-<-<after four-thirty>->->-> when they arrived at the old Red Bull Playhouse in upper St. John Street, and the performance had been under way for more than an hour. The theatre was hot and stuffy, almost humid, and it smelt strongly of sweat and unwashed bodies and powerful perfumes."
"Susan had delivered two boys, Nat at <-<-<-<4:37>->->-> and Peter at 4:43 that afternoon. For the next hour, the parents took turns cuddling them, until Dr. Greenwood suggested that perhaps mother and babies should be allowed to rest."
"She tried not to show her true feelings when at <-<-<-<4:37>->->-> her deputy, Phil Haskins, presented her with a complex twelve-page document that required the signature of a director before it could be sent out to the client.

Rorschach’s journal: Slept all day. Awoken at <-<-<-<4:37>->->->. Landlady complaining about smell.
She should have been home by now. <-<-<-<1637>->->->. Yes. It's as if I had the date of a year on my arm. Every day is a piece of world history.
"At <-<-<-<4:38>->->->, Seb marched into the bank and said to the receptionist, “I have an appointment with Mr. Kaufman.”"
I let him put me in the car and drive me to the station. At <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes to five>->->-> by the clock in the station house I was in front of a cell in the Mill River jail.
"He looked at the clock on his desk: <-<-<-<4:39>->->->. “Get me the checkpoint at Khalis,” he instructed the young Lieutenant."
"Harlem enjoys lazy Sabbath mornings, although the pace picks up again in the afternoon, after church. My watch read <-<-<-<4:39 p.m.>->->->, and I realized that I hadn't eaten all day. I bought two slices of pizza from a sidewalk vendor on 122nd and Lenox Avenue and washed it down with a grape Snapple."
"Kaufman placed his hands together as if in prayer, and when his prayer was answered, he said, “I’ll need to make a few phone calls before I come to a final decision, so come back to my office at <-<-<-<4:40>->->-> tomorrow afternoon. If I’m convinced, we’ll take it from there.”"
"<-<-<-<Four forty>->->-> P.M. Besta sang another hymn. Everyone knew something was wrong. How long did they wait? The mayor was going crazy inside, as was the mayor's wife, as was their daughter. Seiji could barely contain his rage. He was turning as red as his red tuxedo."
"She'd opened the door at <-<-<-<nineteen minutes to five>->->->, thinking she had some measure of control over her world. Now she knew it for the lie it was. Everything she once thought she knew was upside-down; everything had changed."
"It was <-<-<-<just after 4:40>->->-> on Wednesday afternoon. At the back of the newsroom was Graham's office, up several steps from the bullpen area that ran from the front door back to the office. Graham was at his desk trying to hammer out an editorial on his computer, but he was distracted by the television coverage of President Elizabeth Sanderski's funeral."
"In a dream Seymour walks beneath trees towards a cluster of white tents, but every time he takes step forward, the trail twists and the tents recede, and a terrible confusion presses down on him. He wakes with a start. The dashboard clock says <-<-<-<4:42 p.m.>->->-> How long did he sleep?"
"I'm always happy when I reach the finish line of a long-distance race, but this time it really struck me hard. I pumped my right fist into the air. The time was <-<-<-<4:42 pm>->->->. Eleven hours and forty-two minutes since the start of the race."
"Susan had delivered two boys, Nat at 4:37 and Peter at <-<-<-<4:43>->->-> that afternoon. For the next hour, the parents took turns cuddling them, until Dr. Greenwood suggested that perhaps mother and babies should be allowed to rest."
"The only car in the gravel parking lot to the west is Marian the Librarian’s Subaru, humped with snow. <-<-<-<4:43 p.m.>->->->"

"“When did you say you were returning to Amsterdam?”<br>“You know exactly when, because I told you: tomorrow morning.”<br>“Can you get back earlier?”<br>“I could. There’s a KLM flight at <-<-<-<four forty-five p.m.>->->-> today that would get me into Amsterdam just before six.”"
"At <-<-<-<four-forty-five>->->-> Miss Haddon went to tea with the Principal, who explained why she desired all the pupils to learn the same duet. It was part of her new co-ordinative system."
The next day Bill took only ten minutes of the twenty-minute break allotted for the afternoon and left at <-<-<-<fifteen minutes before five>->->->. He parked the car in the lot just as Arlene hopped down from the bus.
"At <-<-<-<4:46>->->-> an obese, middle-aged man shuffled in. Wearing a starched guayabera and dark green pants, Ureña asked for a book on confectionery, then took a seat at the end of the same reading room. Evelina and Leticia exchanged astonished glances. It definitely was one of those days."
"But maybe it was more than that, maybe Affenlight had erred badly somehow, because here it was 4:49 by his watch, <-<-<-<4:47>->->-> by the wall clock, and Owen had not yet come."
"By <-<-<-<four forty-eight>->->-> the five-man team had her back again and the urgent struggle to save Ellen's life continued. She'd now been undergoing surgery for the best part of two hours, and it was doubtful her body could sustain much more trauma."
"Within weeks Tom was on the <-<-<-<4:49 P.M.>->->-> train to New York every Friday afternoon, returning to Hartford on Monday morning. Su Ling kept asking for progress reports, but Nat seemed unusually ill-informed."
"<-<-<-<4:49 p.m.>->->->, a bald-headed man wearing khakis and ankle-high deck shoes came out through the front door of the purple house on 21st Avenue East. The detectives had nicknamed him the General."
"The train standing at Platform 3, the Voice told her, ""is the <-<-<-<4.50>->->-> for Brackhampton, Milchester, Waverton, Carvil Junction, Roxeter and stations to Chadmouth.

"When the clock said <-<-<-<ten minutes to five>->->->, she began to listen, and a few moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tires on the gravel outside, and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in the lock.

"<-<-<-<Ten minutes to five>->->->.<br>""Got to get up in a minute and shell those peas for dinner."""
"At <-<-<-<4:51>->->->, a figure in a cherry - red parka exits the library, pulls up her hood, and pushes a snow shovel up and down the front walk."
"<-<-<-<Nine minutes to five>->->->. If this wasn't some new ordeal, intended to fray her nerves to shreds, if this important person really did exist, if he'd actually set up this appointment, and if, moreover, he arrived on time, then there were nine minutes left."
"The corrida was to begin at five o'clock. The five-footed beasts make a point of arriving at the latest at eight or seven minutes to: ritual again. At <-<-<-<eight minutes to five>->->->, there they were. The urchins gave them a tap on the shoulder: another bit of ritual."

When the last lid had been placed back on he checked the clock on the wall: <-<-<-<six minutes to five>->->->. Just enough time to glance in the other box and see if he could expect the same again.
"At <-<-<-<six minutes before five>->->-> o'clock, Daisy Robinson, about to reach her own apartment door, paused to look and to listen. Something was out of order. Tess Rogan's door was standing wide open and, from within, Daisy could hear something being broken."
"It was <-<-<-<1654>->->-> local time when the Red October broke the surface of the Atlantic Ocean for the first time, forty-seven miles southeast of Norfolk. There was no other ship in sight."

It was <-<-<-<nearly five>->->-> in the evening when the cook came aboard. He did not have the cabbages.
"After an hour, they caught one gold-and-brown-striped fish that was kind of small, and they put him back. Prager swore it was a baby walleye; Eva seemed fairly sure it wasn’t.<br>After another hour of drowning worms and losing them in little nibbles, it was <-<-<-<almost 5:00 p.m.>->->->, and supposedly the best time to catch walleye was in the evening; clearly, they were just too eager and had started too early."
Then at <-<-<-<three minutes to five>->->-> — Pendel had somehow never doubted that Osnard would be punctual — along comes a brown Ford hatchback with an Avis sticker on the back window and pulls into the space reserved for customers.
"At a quarter to three Carol had left home; at half-past four she had created the Georgian town; at a quarter to five she was in the dignified poverty of the Congregational parsonage, her enthusiasm pattering upon Mrs. Leonard Warren like summer rain upon an old gray roof; at <-<-<-<two minutes to five>->->-> a town of demure courtyards and welcoming dormer windows had been erected, and at two minutes past five the entire town was as flat as Babylon."
"It’s <-<-<-<nearly five o’clock>->->-> and the sun has dried the ground so hard that the edges of the lawns are cracked and hard, as threadbare and brown as worn carpet."
"I was told that in his vest pocket he kept a chronometer instead of a watch. If someone asked him what time it was, he would say, ""<-<-<-<A minute and twenty-one seconds to five>->->->."""
<-<-<-<One minute to five>->->->.<br>The needles flashed silver fire. They swam like a tiny school of metal fish in the darkening summer air.
"The gloomy <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> sky was such as you might see on any autumn afternoon. The few houses and the clumps of red or yellowish trees were in no way remarkable. Who could imagine that a little farther on in the quiet landscape I should meet and shake by the hand a man who had lived and eaten and drunk in a world forty million miles distant from London, who had seen this earth from where it looks like a mere point of green fire, and who had spoken with a creature whose life began before our own planet was inhabitable?"
“I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->->.”
"“Shall I see you again before my departure?” asked Albert.<br>“That will be according to the circumstances; when do you set off?”<br>“Tomorrow evening, at <-<-<-<5 o’clock>->->->.”"
"“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.<br>“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at <-<-<-<five>->->-> every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.”"
"Mark was reluctant to go to work, but I said not to worry, I’d be fine. I’d have to be fine eventually and I might as well start now. He said he’d skip out directly after school, get someone else to cover Homework Club; he’d by home by <-<-<-<five>->->->. It was my day off, which struck me as a bit of a waste, but at least I didn’t have to call Sinead and explain why I wasn’t coming in."
"That evening found him sitting at the mouth of a large storm drain on the slope beneath the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge. He had a room, but there was the small matter of stacked-up back rent, which he had absolutely promised to pay as of <-<-<-<5 p.m.>->->-> yesterday. Nor was that all. If he returned to his room, he might be invited to visit a certain fortresslike municipal building on Bess Street, to answer certain questions about a certain bar altercation. On the whole, it seemed safer to stay away."
"My shadow would walk with my on the sand, at least twenty feet long. Hopeful gulls, smelling the croissants in their waxed paper, would circle overhead. And when I walked back, usually around <-<-<-<five>->->-> (although sometimes I stayed later—there was nothing waiting for me in Heaven’s Bay, a town that mostly went sleepybye when summer was over), my shadow walked with me on the water."
"Work started as usual on her twentieth birthday, November 17. It had been raining on and off that afternoon, and pouring since early evening. At <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> the manager gathered the employees together to explain the day’s specials. Servers were required to memorize them word for word and not use crib sheets: veal Milanese, pasta topped with sardines and cabbage, chestnut mousse."
"“But how did it end?” I interrupt.<br>“That’s just it . . . it didn’t end. I promised to see her Tuesday around <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->->. That’s bad, you know! There were lines in her face which will look much worse in daylight. I suppose she wants me to f*** her Tuesday.”"
"With Tania back on the scene, a steady job, the drunken talk about Russia, the walks home at night, and Paris in full summer, life seems to lift its head a little higher. That’s why perhaps, a letter such as Boris sent me seems absolutely cockeyed. Most every day I meet with Tania around <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->->, to have a Porto with her, as she calls it. I let her take me to places I’ve never seen before, the swell bars around the Champs-Élysées where the sound of jazz and baby voices crooning seems to soak right through the mahogany woodwork."
"On earth, the clock commanded our lives. I was always aware of the time, and the day of the week, and the month and year. I had made so many plans, mostly with James. ""See you at my house at <-<-<-<five>->->->"", I would write him, or ""Meet me in the garden tomorrow after school."""
"Next day at <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas."
The house was in darkness. I didn’t know what to expect when I pushed open the front door. Ben would be missing me; he had said he would be home by <-<-<-<five>->->->. I pictured him pacing up and down the living room
"“As part of our effort to discourage drinking and driving, our policy is to courtesy-call people who leave their cars in our lot after closing,” Betsy Neal said. “Your Ford Expedition, Connecticut license plate 775 NSD, will be available for pickup until <-<-<-<five PM>->->-> this evening.”"
"On this one, the dark background looked like the intersection of Market and Powell at <-<-<-<5:00 P.M.>->->->, a virtual traffic jam of compressed, energetic spheres. Speedy messengers, all carrying oxygen to parts of someone else’s body."
"On the principle that the best hiding place is in plain sight, the core group of conspirators met at <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> that afternoon in Kordt’s office in the Prussian State building: Gisevius and von Schulenburg from the Interior Ministry, Dohnányi from Justice, Colonel Oster of the Abwehr, and Kordt and Hartmann from the Foreign Service."
"At <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner."
"“I am going to have a bobbing party,” it said, “on Thursday, December the seventeenth, at <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->->, and I would like it very much if you could come.”"
"At <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> he felt the need of hearing his own voice, so he retreated to his house to see if any one else had arrived. Having climbed the rickety stairs he scrutinized his room resignedly, concluding that it was hopeless to attempt any more inspired decoration than class banners and tiger pictures. There was a tap at the door."
"About three-fourths of the whole business was for effect and therefore harmless, ended at the door of the cafe, soon enough for the <-<-<-<five-o’clock>->->-> train back to Yale or Princeton; about one-fourth continued on into the dimmer hours and gathered strange dust from strange places. Their party was scheduled to be one of the harmless kind."
"At <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters."
<-<-<-<5.00 p.m.>->->-> Read a book
"At <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> that afternoon, while Barbara waited in a taxi, Harold went into the convent in Auteuil and explained to the nun who sat in the concierge's glass cage that Mme. Straus-Muguet was expecting them. He assumed that men were not permitted any further, and that they would all three go out for tea."
"At <-<-<-<five o’clock>->->-> adieux were waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean."
But I took the mixture at <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> in the afternoon. I run my tongue over my dry mouth. I feel dizzy. I know this dizziness: it's because I haven't had a cigarette for hours.
"ERE THE HALF-HOUR ended, <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend; it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor."
From <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure.
"He found it harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->->, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door."
"She had not seen her yet, as Osmond had given her to understand that it was too soon to begin. She drove at <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> to a high floor in a narrow street in the quarter of the Piazza Navona, and was admitted by the portress of the convent, a genial and obsequious person. Isabel had been at this institution before; she had come with Pansy to see the sisters."
Until <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->-> there was no sign of life from the room. Then he rang for his servant and ordered a cold bath.
"We motored, I remember, leaving London in the morning in a heavy shower of rain, coming to Manderley about <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->->, in time for tea. I can see myself now, unsuitably dressed as usual, although a bride of seven weeks, in a tan-coloured stockinette frock, a small fur known as a stone marten round my neck, and over all a shapeless mackintosh, far too big for me and dragging to my ankles."
"I haven't been to church in over a year.<br>""Finally worried about your soul?""<br>""Please,"" Cork said<br>""Of course we can talk. When?""<br>""Tomorrow. Late afternoon maybe. Say <-<-<-<five o'clock>->->->?""<br>""Make it six,"" the priest suggested. ""My office.""<br>""I'll be there,"" Cork promised."
"At <-<-<-<one minute past five>->->->, Beth left the museum, hailed a taxi and, after giving the driver her address, sat in the back surrounded by boxes and unashamedly shed a tear."
<-<-<-<One minute after five>->->->. The seated guests were told that the ceremony would begin shortly. A little more patience was required.
"“<-<-<-<Two minutes past five>->->->.”<br>“Then the deal is closed. And as long as I pay the remaining ninety percent within thirty days, Shifnal Farm is mine.”"
"She stood up, shook her hair into place, smoothed her skirt and turned on the light. It was <-<-<-<two minutes past five>->->->. She would have thought it midnight or five in the morning."
"Good evening, Mrs. Scheindlin, the man said before departing.<br>""Good evening, Chris. Say hello to the wife for me.""<br>""I sure will. Thanks. Bye,"" he said, waving to Elliot, who returned the goodbye. It was <-<-<-<5:03>->->-> when Elliot rested the handset in its cradle."
"I looked down at the watch Trey had given me last Christmas, the delicate gold links so real and solid, and it seemed like someone else’s memory strapped to someone else’s shaking hand. It was <-<-<-<5:03>->->-> now. I was halfway to my house."
"Frank Wamsley spotted his cousin Barbara and her husband and waved to them. Just ahead, he saw Marvin and his two friends. Suddenly the whole bridge convulsed. The time was <-<-<-<5:04 P.M.>->->-> Steel screamed."
"At approximately <-<-<-<5:05 p.m.>->->-> Joe became aware of a man standing close to the table, about two metres away, talking in Mandarin into a mobile phone. He was a middle-aged Han wearing cheap leather slip-on shoes, high-waisted black trousers and a white short-sleeved shirt."
"In her ledger the historic moment of delivery was later put at <-<-<-<six past five>->->->, which was a lie but gave it force."
"Hallorann arrived <-<-<-<shortly after five in the afternoon>->->->, behind the wheel of his now ancient (but perfectly maintained and blindingly polished) red Cadillac. Wendy had been standing at the window, waiting and watching as she had once waited and watched for her husband, hoping Jack would come in in a good mood. And sober."
The rain stopped <-<-<-<around 5 p.m.>->->-> and a few of those people who were out and about expressed mild surprise when the rainbow failed to fade.
"As I looked at its huge dial, and at the pendulum moving to and fro regularly and slowly in Space, as if its swinging meant to divide eternity, I saw its needles pointing to <-<-<-<seven minutes past five>->->->."
"<-<-<-<About five>->->->, the Abbot, a young Manchester terrier, began chirruping. He stood on the body of his owner, Flora, with his forepaws on the sill of the balcony, stared through the green rattan blinds, and trembled. He could see the farmer in the field, and Edward asleep on the next balcony."
"The last communication we had with Dwight Sloane was yesterday. <-<-<-<Five-oh-eight P.M.>->->-> Here. He put his finger on a lake called Embarrass. ""He should have checked in four hours later. He didn't."""
"She looked at her watch and saw it was <-<-<-<nine minutes past five>->->->. ""It's happening, Daddy! The sun's going out!""<br>""Yes,"" he agreed."
"It was still coming sunward and nearly at the point of closest approach to Farholme - estimated to be at one hundred thousand kilometers out - but was still behaving itself. When the Guardian checked again at <-<-<-<5:10 p.m.>->->->, it expected to find it sunward from us, but it was absent from the predicted path.”"
"She gave him a strange, subdued smile. “Not so fast, my friend. In theory, yes, it could have been a ship, mimicking a meteoriod. But there is the timing point. It had gone by at <-<-<-<5:10 p.m.>->->-> Central Menaya time and Merral saw his object come in ten minutes earlier at around 6:00 p.m. Eastern Menaya time."""
"Didna ye hear the pipes, my leddy? he rejoined.<br>""Yes, well enough; but a whole regiment of pipes can't make it six o'clock when my watch says <-<-<-<ten minutes past five>->->->."""
"The earpiece crackled and he scrawled down the numbers. Cut the switchboard off and dialed Holly’s pager. Just got a long low tone telling him the pager was switched off. Then he tried the cell phone number. He got an electronic bleep and a recorded message of a woman telling him the phone he was dialing was unreachable. He hung up and looked around the room. It was <-<-<-<ten after five>->->->, Monday afternoon."
"<-<-<-<Five ten P.M.>->->-> A ground-to-ground cruise missile, launched from a tractor installed in the backyard of Leonard Sudavico's former home by Rashan and a crew of technicians from Afghanistan, exploded onto the Paul Clay estate in the exact spot where the life-size mermaid had once swum in the waterfall."
"Hours later, at <-<-<-<ten minutes past five>->->->, Saturday afternoon, Nora and Travis and Jim Keene crowded in front of the mattress on which Einstein lay. The dog had just taken a few more ounces of water. He looked at them with interest, too. Travis tried to decide if those large brown eyes still had the strange depth, uncanny alertness, and undoglike awareness that he had seen in them so many times before."
At <-<-<-<eleven minutes past five>->->-> Dick Bellamy stopped Melchard's car outside the booking-office of somnolent Harthborough's dead-alive station - the junction of the single-line track to Whitebay and its bathing machines with the double-track branch of the G.N.R.
"Well, here we are, said Colonel Julyan, ""and it's exactly <-<-<-<twelve minutes past five>->->->. We shall catch them in the middle of their tea. Better wait for a bit."" Maxim lit a cigarette, and then stretched out his hand to me. He did not speak."
So at <-<-<-<17.13>->->-> Callum Green was buying a necklace and something like a couple hours later he was dead.
"Do you know what time it is, Atticus? she said. ""Exactly <-<-<-<fourteen minutes past five>->->->. The alarm clock's set for five-thirty. I want you to know that."""
"It was only a <-<-<-<quarter past five>->->->, but the evening was as dark as midnight. And when he reached the edge of the porch the rain began falling."
It was about <-<-<-<5:15>->->-> when Grant noticed a new face entering the room. He was a priest roughly Grant's age. The medium-built man looked a bit disheveled.
"<-<-<-<5:15 P.M.>->->-><br>Yep, Jack Cermak’s Corner Tap was the eighth circle of hell. In a gentrifying neighborhood like Logan Square, setting up a sanitized, overpriced bar to look like a cheap small-town dive was just plain sick."
When August Bach emerged from the gloomy chill of the air-conditioned Divisional Fighter Control bunker it was <-<-<-<17:15 hrs>->->-> CET. The day had ripened into one of those mellow summer afternoons when the air is warm and sweet like soft toffee
"I think the first one I remember happening was on the London Underground, Circle line, <-<-<-<17.16 p.m.>->->-><br>She went on to describe what had happened or not quite happened."
"And it was just <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past five>->->-> when Dick French, hanging in a frenzy of anxiety over the paddock fence circling the inside of the mile oval, uttered something resembling a howl and rushed to the gate to signal his recreant driver."
"Lupin rose, without breaking his contemptuous silence, and took the sheet of paper. I remembered soon after that, at this moment, I happened to look at the clock. It was <-<-<-<eighteen minutes past five>->->->."
"Thursday <-<-<-<5:18 P.M.>->->-><br>Yuri Andreevich was mad as hell. After his one-on-one with Tanzan Mino, he knew he'd been screwed. Sticking a couple of ""pilots"" from Mino Industries in the cockpit. It was just the old GRU trick, surveillance under the specious guise of ""support."" He'd seen it all before."
Scott eased himself into the corner before once again checking the little sulphur dots on his watch. It was <-<-<-<5:19>->->->. He and Hannah had been in the safe for an hour and seventeen minutes.
"The call came at <-<-<-<5.19 p.m.>->->-> The line was surprisingly clear. A man introduced himself as Major Liepa from the Riga police. Wallander made notes as he listened, occasionally answering a question."
"I'm going to park here and walk in. I don't want to drive into a zoo. He glanced at his watch. ""It's only <-<-<-<five-twenty>->->->. Kidnapper's call is supposed to come at six. We've got time."""
"If she can keep her speed to seventy until she leaves the turnpike at midtown, and if she catches most of the traffic lights, she estimates she can be at her building by <-<-<-<five-twenty>->->->."
"The Meeting was listed as starting at 1730, and it was only around <-<-<-<1720>->->->, and Hal thought the voices might signify some sort of pre-Meeting orientation for people who've come for the first time, sort of tentatively, just to scout the whole enterprise out, so he doesn't knock."
"He next proceeded to examine seriatim the dead man's pockets, turning each of them inside out and taking the contents, where they appeared adapted to his needs: for instance, a silken purse, through the interstices of which some gold was visible; a watch, which however had been injured by the explosion, and had stopt just at the moment - <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes past five>->->-> - when the catastrophe took place."
"I expect she didn't want Octavia to know that she'd called in her father, not until they'd worked out a plan. And I was the one who fixed the time. I didn't see how I could catch a train before the <-<-<-<seventeen-twenty-two>->->-> which gets in to Waterloo at nineteen-twenty-nine."
"I was wondering if we could meet for a drink.<br>""What for?""<br>""Just for a chat. Do you know the Royal batsman, near Central Station? We could meet tomorrow at five?""<br>""<-<-<-<Five twenty-three>->->->,"" I said, to exert some control over the situation."
"At Baltimore, it was said, twelve hours after the passage of the sun of the meridian of Kilimanjaro, it was <-<-<-<5:24 P.M.>->->-> It is impossible to describe the pangs which were produced at this moment. The most powerful of modern pens would be helpless at the task. The people of Baltimore stood fearing that they would be swept off the surface of the earth by the terrible mass of water which would fall on their city."
By <-<-<-<5:25>->->-> neither of them was at his side and his famous “cool” was beginning to show distinct signs of steaming.
"I left Weymouth Street at about <-<-<-<five twenty-five>->->->, but I expect the dental nurse and the receptionist will be able to confirm the time. I found that my motorcycle had been taken."
"It was <-<-<-<five-twenty-five>->->-> when I pulled up in front of the library. Still early for our date, so I got out of the car and took a stroll down the misty streets. In a coffee shop, watched a golf match on television, then I went to an entertainment center and played a video game. The object of the game was to wipe out tanks invading from across the river. I was winning at first, but as the game went on, the enemy tanks bred like lemmings, crushing me by sheer number and destroying my base. An on-screen nuclear blast took care of everything, followed by the message game over insert coin."
"Now, said Handsley, when Angela had poured out the last cup, ""it's <-<-<-<twenty-five minutes past five>->->->, at half-past the Murder game is on."""
"There's a train that leaves Totnes at <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes past five>->->-> this afternoon, I said, ""and it reaches London at-"""
"One evening at <-<-<-<5:27>->->->, when Septimus was closing the file on the last claim for the day, his immediate superior, the deputy manager, called him in for a consultation."
"Thursday <-<-<-<5:27 P.M.>->->-><br>""Strasvetye,"" came a voice behind Eva. ""Kak pazhavatye.""<br>She whirled around. Moving in fast was a tall and — admit it — not bad-looking Soviet major."
"And so, when he told her on May 15 at <-<-<-<5:28>->->-> in the afternoon that he had to be moving on, she passed out. She was in his bed at the time."
"Well? he said.<br>""It's <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes past five>->->->, Insert Name Here,"" said the imp nervously."
"He picks her up, places her on the bed, lies down beside her. He kisses her again, tentatively, lingeringly. Then he asks what time it is. He himself has no watch. Lesje tells him it’s <-<-<-<five-thirty>->->->. He sits up. Lesje is beginning to feel slightly unattractive. Are her teeth too large, is that it?"
"It was <-<-<-<half-past five>->->-> before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits, a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression."
"How could anyone say no to Erin Cook?<br>Well, God said no. God burned Tom Kennedy’s lot, and He burned hers in the process. When I picked up the phone at <-<-<-<five-thirty>->->-> on a gorgeous October afternoon in Westchester, that girl had become a woman whose voice, blurry with the tears, sounded old and tired to death."
"Finally, around <-<-<-<5:30>->->->, Eva’s red-and-white bobber plunked below the water, and her thin green rod bowed with an invigorating weight. It was another one of the gold-and-brown guys, beautiful and gasping, held aloft by his lips, urgently splattering the air."
"He went up to his coachman, who was dozing on the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick lime-tree; he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses, and, waking the coachman, he jumped into the carriage, and told him to drive to Bryansky’s. It was only after driving nearly five miles that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch, and realise that it was <-<-<-<half-past five>->->->, and he was late."
"October 6.— So as not to have too far to walk, I go out about four intending to stop in at the ""Nouvelle France,"" where Nadja is supposed to meet me at <-<-<-<5:30>->->->. This gives me time to stroll around the boulevards not far from the Opéra, I have to pick up my pen from the shop where it is being repaired."
"They discussed the transmission: which of their friends, they wondered, was responsible for it? But at <-<-<-<17:31>->->-> Pick called back"
"Tuesday <-<-<-<5:31 P.M.>->->-><br>""It's the best I can manage, Michael."" Nogami's voice was apologetic. ""Nobody knows I keep this place, not even my wife.""<br>""Afternoon business conferences.""<br>""You catch my meaning."" He smiled and walked on up the sandstone steps."
"It was exactly <-<-<-<thirty-two minutes past five o'clock>->->-> on the evening of Friday, December 9th, when the station-master at Anerly received the following communication by wire from the signal box at Froest Hill: 5.28 down from London Bridge just passed."
He and Lady Ursula were back at number sixty-two by <-<-<-<five thirty-three>->->->. He could remember the time exactly because he had looked at the car clock.
It was <-<-<-<five thirty-three>->->-> when we left. Is it six o'clock now? Six thirty? And Mark's still in his cage and I'm scared to drive very fast. . . what if we don't get there in time?
"At <-<-<-<5:33 p.m.>->->-> there is a blast of two deep, resonant notes a major third apart. On another day there is the same blast at 12:54 p.m. On another, exactly 8:00 a.m."
"At five-thirty. I was here about <-<-<-<four minutes later>->->->. Judging by the appearance of the blood and the beginning of rigor in the side of the face, I guessed that he had been dead about five hours."
"At <-<-<-<5:35>->->->, he got word over the radio that Helmunth Hanover of the Aurora Sentinel had received a call from an anonymous spokesperson for the Minnesota Civilian Brigade threatening some form of retaliation if the Indians fished."
"At that moment I looked again at my watch because I wanted to be back at the Cathedral as Evensong ended at about twenty to six in order to talk to the choirmaster before he left. I saw I only had four minutes before it ended.<br>""So that occurred at <-<-<-<precisely twenty-four minutes before six>->->->?""<br>""Exactly."""
"Look, Lucille, said Joe when Lucille strolled into the office at <-<-<-<5:37>->->->. ""I don't know what you said to this gal, but it seems to have had exactly the opposite of the desired effect. She's got some bee in her bonnet about Harvard Law School."""
"And then I see something I recognise. Some little green digits, glowing in the blackness. It’s Ben’s alarm clock. Somehow I’m back here, in the apartment. I blink the numbers. <-<-<-<17:38>->->->. But that can’t be right. That’s the afternoon."
"He stares at the phone, thinks: Ring. Ring now. But it remains inert. <-<-<-<5.38 p.m.>->->-> Bunny will be done with her housekeeping shift by now."
"It was <-<-<-<5.38 p.m.>->->-> when the Prime Minister’s plane finally broke through the clouds and appeared above Heston Aerodrome. As the ground flickered into view, Legat could see the traffic along the Great West Road. Cars were halted for more than a mile in either direction. It had been raining heavily."
"It’s <-<-<-<05:39>->->-> so we can have dinner, it’s quick noodles. While they’re in the hot water, Ma finds hard words to test me from the milk carton like nutritional that means food, and pasteurized that means laser guns zapped away the germs."
"As no one had “any other business” to raise, I closed the meeting at <-<-<-<5:40>->->->, and suggested to Jeremy that he join Rosemary and me for dinner. I wanted to see them together."
"What? I said, ""is it 5:30 yet?""<br>""Er, <-<-<-<5:40>->->->."" Heavens, they'll be starving. But then that's a good thing. Let them."
"It's <-<-<-<five-forty>->->-> now. The party's at six. By about ten past, the eleventh floor should be clearing. Arnold is a very popular partner; no one's going to miss his farewell speech if they can help it. Plus, at Carter Spink parties, the speeches always happen early on, so people can get back to work if they need to. And while everyone's listening I'll slip down to Arnold's office. It should work. It has to work. As I stare at my own bizarre reflection, I feel a grim resolve hardening inside me. He's not going to get away with everyone thinking he's a cheery, harmless old teddy bear. He's not going to get away with it."
"All right, people, let's haul ass. Sunset's at <-<-<-<17:41>->->-> and we've got twenty-three k to go. Staff Segeant Beyn got to his feet and the platoon followed."
"Well, they set sail, and after going ever so many thousand miles, or hundred - I forget which, but it doesn't matter- a great storm arose, a typhoon or simoon, perhaps both; and after slowly gathering up its energies for the space of twenty-nine days, seven hours, and twenty-three minutes, without counting the seconds, it burst upon them at exactly <-<-<-<forty-two minutes past five>->->->, on the sixth day of the week."
"“I always prefer to travel on a British carrier,” Don Pedro told the purser as they were shown to their seats in first class. The Boeing Stratocruiser took off at <-<-<-<5:43 p.m.>->->->, just a few minutes behind schedule."
"It’s <-<-<-<5:43>->->->. Time is racing, racing."
Janice is not waiting for him in the lounge or beside the pool when at last <-<-<-<around 5.45>->->-> they come home from playing the par-5 eighteenth. Instead one of the girls in their green and white uniforms comes over and tells him that his wife wants him to call home.
"“A <-<-<-<quarter to six>->->->,” answered the midwife.<br>“And what if I really am dying?” thought Olga Mihalovna, looking at her husband’s head and the window-panes on which the rain was beating."
"At <-<-<-<a quarter to six>->->->, there was a rapping sound outside my door. I checked out the peephole. Ramirez stood outside, dressed in a big red basketball-type tank top, black shorts, and flip-flops."
"At <-<-<-<fourteen minutes to six>->->-> they walked into the director’s study, where a young lady of Sally’s age offered the guests a choice of dry sherry or orange juice."
"Then I take it the matter is practically concluded, said the clergyman. ""And that you very properly submit to return to your proper home. And now, if I may offer a suggestion, it is that we take tea. Freed of its tannin, nothing, I think, is more refreshing and stimulating.""<br>""There's a train from Lyndhurst at <-<-<-<thirteen minutes to six>->->->,"" said Widgery, unfolding a time table."
Father came home at <-<-<-<5:48 p.m.>->->-> I heard him come through the front door. Then he came into the living room. He was wearing a lime green and sky blue check shirt and there was a double knot on one of his shoes but not on the other.
"<-<-<-<5:49 P.M.>->->->, SUNDAY, JUNE 8TH, 1924 WHEN ODELL ARRIVED back at Camp IV, he was unable to conceal his excitement. He crawled into Norton’s tent and told him what he’d seen."
It was <-<-<-<eleven minutes to six>->->->. After a moment he idly drew the center drawer of the desk out over his lap. For a moment he stared at the gun without recognition. Then he gave a yelp and leaped up. She had put it back!
He glanced up at the clock above the door: <-<-<-<ten to six>->->->. Young Kevin would appear through that door at any moment and ask if he would be kind enough to move on.
"What time is it Jack?<br>""<-<-<-<Ten to six>->->->""<br>""Ten more minutes then."" I shuffle the cards. ""Time for a quick game of rummy?"""
"Esterville had called the truck stop, but no one had seen his wife come in. She hadn't returned home. Cork and McDougal found her red Mustang at <-<-<-<5:50>->->->."
"She read through the first page slowly and made of a couple of emendations, aware that any mistake made hastily on a Friday evening could be regretted in the weeks to come. She glanced at the clock on her desk as she signed the final page of the document. It was just showing <-<-<-<5:51>->->->."
"The sun was red and the shadows were long and dark. It wanted but <-<-<-<nine minutes to six>->->->, and within the hotel the disgraceful National Swill was in full flow, men pouring as much liquor down their throats as possible before the fatal hour of drought arrived."
"It was <-<-<-<eight minutes to six o'clock>->->->. ""I must get him,"" he told the telephone girl for the dozenth time.<br>""Sorry- no one will answer,"" she said wearily."
"That boy will be spoiled, as sure as I go on springs; he's made such a lot of. Have you been regulated?<br>""I should think I have!"" exclaimed I, in indignant recollection of my education.<br>""All right; keep your temper. What time are you?""<br>""<-<-<-<Seven minutes to six>->->->."""
"It was <-<-<-<5:54 p.m.>->->-> when Father came back into the living room. He said, ""What is this?"" but he said it very quietly and I didn't realise that he was angry because he wasn't shouting."
"One, two, three, four, five, six… She wound each clock in turn, three turns each, putting just enough power in the springs to get them ticking in time for Mr Westcott’s inspection. Speaking of which…it was <-<-<-<five minutes to six>->->->. Five minutes before Mr. Westcott would arrive to inspect his clocks. Helena swallowed. She could hear footsteps thundering in the room below and the occasional exclamation from Stanley."
"The wind moaned and sang dismally, catching the ears and lifting the shabby coat-tails of Mr. Mortimer Jenkyn, 'Photographic Artist', as he stood outside and put the shutters up with this own cold hands in despair of further trade. It was <-<-<-<five minutes to six>->->->."
"Now, sir, the hand wants <-<-<-<four minutes to six>->->->. If the hour strike before you call yourself a wanton, gratuitous calumniator, I'll flog you round the room."
"At <-<-<-<three minutes to six>->->->, despite there still being no sign of Sally, the director suggested they should all make their way to the Great Hall."
"At <-<-<-<three minutes to six>->->->, a tall, well-built man of military bearing pushed his way through the revolving doors. His dark navy blazer, gray flannels, short hair and highly polished shoes all suggested a life of discipline."
"Hugo Carmody had done this, with the result that by <-<-<-<three minutes to six>->->-> he was feeling as if he had been marooned among roses since the beginning of summer."
"He would make his way by charm, the charm of voice, of jewel-like language, above all by the intellectual charm of new, moving, luminous ideas. At <-<-<-<three minutes to six>->->-> the doctor closed the book and waited."
"Then I notice the windows: they're shiny dark. <-<-<-<17:58>->->->, insists my watch. It can't be. It's only just gone four. I peer around my tormentor's belly to find Immaculée Constantin, but she's gone."
"At <-<-<-<one minute to six>->->->, the director led the guest of honor onto the stage. He watched the four hundred girls rise and applaud him in what the director would have described as a “ladylike” manner."
"It was <-<-<-<nearly six o'clock>->->-> in the evening, and the absurd bell in the six-foot tin steeple of the church went clank-clank, clank- clank! as old Mattu pulled the rope within."
"When he arrived it was <-<-<-<nearly six o'clock>->->->, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks."
"I haven't been to church in over a year.<br>""Finally worried about your soul?""<br>""Please,"" Cork said<br>""Of course we can talk. When?""<br>""Tomorrow. Late afternoon maybe. Say five o'clock?""<br>""Make it <-<-<-<six>->->->,"" the priest suggested. ""My office.""<br>""I'll be there,"" Cork promised."
"Would a minute have mattered? No, probably not, although his young son appeared to have a very accurate internal clock. Possibly even two minutes would be okay. Three minutes, even. You could go to five minutes, perhaps. But that was just it. If you could go for five minutes, then you’d go to ten, then half an hour, a couple of hours…and not see your son all evening. So that was that. <-<-<-<Six o’clock>->->->, prompt. Every day. Read to young Sam. No excuses. He’d promised himself that. No excuses. No excuses at all. Once you had a good excuse, you opened the door to bad excuses."
"“When did you say you were returning to Amsterdam?”<br>“You know exactly when, because I told you: tomorrow morning.”<br>“Can you get back earlier?”<br>“I could. There’s a KLM flight at four forty-five p.m. today that would get me into Amsterdam just before <-<-<-<six>->->->.”"
"Rick pulled into his driveway, his old Explorer coated in a hazy film of white salt. The winter night had rolled in quickly, the town bathed in darkness by <-<-<-<six p.m.>->->-> He asked Bill to grab his papers and a bit of weed."
"As <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> approached, Cryer strolled to the open door of the CAD room. Tom Penny, chewing his lip, was gazing hypnotically at the wall clock."
"“It’s only <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->->,” he observed with a yawn, and then, in a moment, he made an even more interesting discovery."
"When is his tea-time? I inquired.<br>""Oh, at <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->->. He keeps early hours in the country. You had better change your frock now: I will go with you and fasten it. Here is a candle."""
"“What about Nicholas?” Meryl asked as she handed the sheet back to me. I glanced down at the list; there was one space left, the last appointment of the day <-<-<-<six p.m.>->->-><br>“I’ll pop him down there. Could someone let him know?”<br>“I will,” Meryl said.<br>I pencilled his name in with a question mark."
"Dan lay awake until <-<-<-<six>->->->. Then he dressed and once more made the trek to the Red Apple. This time he did not hesitate, only instead of extracting two bottles of Bird from the cooler, he took three. What was it they used to say? Go big or go home."
"Sometimes the manager would play the role of a customer and test them with questions. Then came the employees’ meal: waiters in this restaurant were not going to have growling stomachs as they took their customers’ order!<br>The restaurant opened its doors at <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->->, but guests were slow to arrive  because of the downpour, and several reservations were simply canceled."
"But what was my original self? I couldn’t be sure anymore. I couldn’t help feeling that it was another me, another self that strongly resembled my original self. So now what was I to do? I had lost all sense of direction. I shoved my hand into my pocket and fed every piece of change I found there into a pay phone. Eight rings. Nine. And then she answered.<br>“I was sleeping,” she said with a yawn.<br>“At <-<-<-<six o’clock in the evening>->->->?”"
"Ursula invites me into the wardrobe. “You haven’t aged a day, Timbo, and neither has 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 snaky fellow!” Her furry fawn rubs up against my Narnian-sized lamppost and mothballs . . . but then, as ever, I awoke, my swollen appendage as welcome as a swollen appendix, and as useful. <-<-<-<Six o’clock>->->->. The heating systems composed works in the style of John Cage. Chillblains burned my toe knuckles. I thought about Christmases gone, so many more gone than lay ahead."
"At <-<-<-<6:00 p.m.>->->-> I race home from work and attempt to make myself attractive. Home these days is a tiny bit insanely expensive studio apartment on North Dearborn; I am constantly banging parts of myself on inconvenient walls, countertops and furniture."
"“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->->?”"
"Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by."
"She sounded surprised, and possibly also disappointed. He said, “Listen, I can’t speak for long, so please concentrate on what I’m about to say. I want you to pack a week’s worth of clothes and get the garage to drive you and the children to your parents’ right away.”<br>“But it’s <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->->.”<br>“They’ll still be open.”<br>“Why do we have to go in such a rush? What’s happened?”<br>“Nothing. Nothing yet, anyway. I just want to know you’re somewhere safe.”<br>“It sounds rather panicky. I hate people who panic.”"
"Lucinda Quant breaks the story of the big leak on the <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> news. She’s straightforward, she’s believable, and, best of all, she has extensive document trails and video footage. She tells the story about how she came by her treasure trove of dirt, though she doesn’t name names"
"Out along the dim <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> street, I saw leafless trees standing, striking the sidewalk there like wooden lightning, concrete split apart where they hit, all in a fenced-in ring. An iron line of pickets stuck out of the ground along the front of a tangleweed yard, and on back was a big frame house with a porch, leaning a rickety shoulder hard into the wind so’s not to be sent tumbling away a couple of blocks like an empty cardboard grocery box."
"At most times of the day—except during <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> Mass—Dervla could be found spying out of her bedroom window. Bolstering her hunched torso with large pillows, she stared with beady, rhubarb gray eyes out into the damp street below, determined not to miss a minute of provincial drama."
"“You are remarkable, aren’t you!” Amory was becoming trite from where he perched in the centre of the dining-room table one <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->->."
"“<-<-<-<Six o’clock>->->->,” said Amory, glancing at his wrist-watch. “I’ll buy you a grea’ big dinner on the strength of the Juvenalia of your collected editions.”"
"And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, ""he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always <-<-<-<six o’clock>->->-> now."""
<-<-<-<6.00 p.m.>->->-> Have tea
"Although it was only <-<-<-<six o'clock>->->->, the night was already dark. The fog, made thicker by its proximity to the Seine, blurred every detail with its ragged veils, punctured at various distances by the reddish glow of lanterns and bars of light escaping from illuminated windows."
"Did you go down to the farm while I was away?<br>""No,"" I said ""but I saw Ted.""<br>""Did he have a message for me?"" she asked. ""He said today was no good as he was going to Norwich. But Friday at <-<-<-<six o'clock>->->->, same as usual.""<br>""Are you sure he said six o'clock?"" she asked, puzzled.<br>""Quite sure."""
"King Richard: What is o'clock?<br>Catesby: It is <-<-<-<six o'clock>->->->, full supper time.<br>King Richard: I will not sup tonight. Give me some ink and paper."
"Leon waited all day for <-<-<-<six o'clock>->->-> to arrive; when he got to the inn, he found no one there but Monsieur Binet, already at the table."
Oh oh oh. <-<-<-<Six o'clock>->->-> and the master not home yet.
The newspaper snaked through the door and there was suddenly a <-<-<-<six o'clock>->->-> feeling in the house
The winter evening settles down With smell of steaks in passageways. <-<-<-<Six o'clock>->->->.
"When the bells of Calvary Church struck <-<-<-<six>->->->, she saw Mr. and Mrs. Biggs hurrying down the front stoop, rushing off to the shops before they closed."

"“No one stops, even to draw breath, until <-<-<-<one minute past six>->->-> when the last vote will have been cast."""
"David had followed me at <-<-<-<one minute past six>->->->. Then three others had managed to get away, making it five altogether. But as the sixth Hurricane was gathering speed for lift-off, a swarm of Messerschmitts had come swooping in over the olive trees."
"Incidentally, confirmed by a record of a small and poorly defined shallow-focus earthquake around two hundred and fifty kilometers north of Herrandown at <-<-<-<6:02 p.m.>->->-> But there is a major problem."
Jarrod stared at the clock on his computer. It said <-<-<-<6:03>->->->. Outside his office window it was dark. It felt as if someone had sucked all the oxygen from the room and he took an extra breath before responding.
"Above it all rose the Houses of Parliament, with the hands of the clock stopped at <-<-<-<three minutes past six>->->->. It was difficult to believe that all that meant nothing any more, that now it was just a pretentious confection that could decay in peace."
"We will make record of it, my Rosannah; every year, as this dear hour chimes from the clock, we will celebrate it with thanksgivings, all the years of our life.<br>""We will, we will, Alonzo!""<br>""<-<-<-<Four minutes after six>->->->, in the evening, my Rosannah..."""

At about <-<-<-<five past six>->->-> Piers came in carrying an evening paper and a few books.
"At <-<-<-<6:06>->->->, every toilet on Merit Street suddenly exploded in a geyser of shit and raw sewage as some unimaginable reversal took place in the pipes which fed the holding tanks of the new waste-treatment plant in the Barrens."
"According to the Book of Revelation, the great beast's number is 666. So that exact time would be <-<-<-<six minutes past six>->->-> on the sixth of the sixth, sixty-six. Double whammy."
"The minutes ticked by. The silence in the room roared in their ears. At <-<-<-<seven minutes past six>->->->, Charles's phone rang."

"Let me see now. You had a drink at the Continental at <-<-<-<six ten>->->->.<br>""Yes.""<br>""And at six forty-five you were talking to another journalist at the door of the Majestic?""<br>""Yes, Wilkins. I told you all this, Vigot, before. That night."""
"The first explosion occurred at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past six>->->->. The chart-house and part of the bridge were blown to pieces. Three dull, splintering crashes ensued in rapid succession, proving beyond question that the bombs were set to automatically explode at a given time."
"Bill Russell left the office at <-<-<-<6:12>->->-> that evening, and never entered the building again."
"He checked his watch: <-<-<-<6:12 p.m.>->->-> He left the dining room and went downstairs to the wine cellar. A single bulb lit a room that had once stored filing cabinets full of archives. Since Giles’s arrival, they had been replaced by wine racks."
"Wednesday <-<-<-<6:12 P.M.>->->-><br>The dusk was settling majestically over Tokyo, after a rare smogless day. The view was particularly inspiring from the fifty-fifth-floor penthouse of the granite-clad Mino Industries building."
"At <-<-<-<06:12>->->-> Noreen brings another whole tray that’s dinner, we can have dinner at five something or six something or even seven something, Ma says."

"Is he conscious? Has the ether—<br>""I can't say as to that,"" said Simmy cheerfully. ""He's been back in his room since five o'clock. That's—let's see what time is it now? <-<-<-<Six-fourteen>->->->. Nearly an hour and a quarter. They all say—"""
"<-<-<-<Quarter past six>->->->, said Tony. ""He's bound to have told her by now."""
At a <-<-<-<quarter past six>->->-> he was through with them.
I checked the time on the corner of my screen. <-<-<-<6.15 pm.>->->-> I was never going to finish my essay in forty-five minutes
"The clock above the door said <-<-<-<sixteen minutes past six>->->->. The pictures showed the door opening and a rug coming in - just the rug, flat, held up perpendicular, hanging straight down. Of course there was someone behind it."
The printed front of the card read Bernis Sand. On the back was written in pencil: your westbound tram stop at <-<-<-<18:17>->->->. There was no date or signature. At 18:17 Adele stepped out of the townhouse with Trovera at her side.
"He glanced at his watch, <-<-<-<6.18 p.m.>->->->, and moved into first gear. He climbed off the bed, stripped off his clothes and threw them over a chair before going into the bathroom and taking a long shower."
It was at <-<-<-<18:18>->->-> when a sixty-one-year-old Tibetan woman telephoned for a fire engine to put out a burning car.

"By the time Elliot's mother arrived at <-<-<-<twenty past six>->->->, Mrs. Sen always made sure all evidence of her chopping was disposed of."
"5.20 pm - <-<-<-<6.21 pm>->->->: Miss Pettigrew found herself wafted into the passage. She was past remonstrance now, past bewilderment, surprise, expostulation. Her eyes shone. Her face glowed. Her spirits soared. Everything was happening too quickly. She couldn't keep up with things, but, by golly, she could enjoy them."
"<-<-<-<18:22 GMT>->->-><br>""The firearms squad is in place, sir,"" said a lone voice over the intercom, sounding like a crack of thunder, after a couple of hours of silence."
"It was <-<-<-<six twenty-two>->->->, Commander. I happened to glance at the clock.<br>He held open the door wide. It seemed less an invitation to leave than a command."
Clock overturned when he fell forward. That'll give us the time of the crime. <-<-<-<Twenty-two minutes past six>->->->.

"We were cleared by the tower at <-<-<-<18:24>->->-> and got airborne seven minutes after the scheduled departure time. The evening sky was almost clear, with a scattering of cumulous along the southern horizon and the windsocks hanging limp."
"Without preamble, Dalgliesh said, ""Mrs. Tallulah Clutton, the housekeeper at the Dupayne Museum, has this afternoon recognized you as the motorist who knocked her off her bicycle at about <-<-<-<six twenty-five>->->-> on Friday the first of November. On that night two people were murdered at the museum, Dr. Neville Dupayne and Miss Celia Mellock."""
At <-<-<-<6:25>->->-> Claudia locked away the files she had been working on and went upstairs to wash and fetch her coat. The house was ablaze with light. Since Gerard's death she had hated working alone in the darkness.
"At <-<-<-<twenty-five past six>->->-> I go into the bathroom and have a wash, then while the Old Lady's busy in the kitchen helping Chris with the washing up I get my coat and nip out down the stairs."
"I have this moment, while writing, had a wire from Jonathan saying that he leaves by the <-<-<-<6.25>->->-> tonight from Launceston and will be here at 10.18, so that I shall have no fear tonight."
"I checked the time on my mobile phone - <-<-<-<18:26 p.m.>->->-><br>""Do you want to grab a pizza?"" Cara asked as she walked in twenty minutes later. I looked up at her. She shook her head smiling, questioning."

It was <-<-<-<6:27>->->->. In Frances Peverell's flat the phone rang. As soon as James spoke her name she knew that something was wrong.

"Lieutenant Hershel Mote could not keep the note of near hysteria out of his voice when Wesley returned his telephone call at <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes past six p.m.>->->-><br>""You're where?"" Wesley asked him again on the speaker phone."
"<-<-<-<SIX-THIRTY>->->-> ON REACHER’S watch, the motion inside the truck changed. Six hours and four minutes they’d cruised steadily, maybe fifty-five or sixty miles an hour, while the heat peaked and fell away. He’d sat, hot and rocking and bouncing in the dark with the wheel well between him and Holly Johnson, ticking off the distance against a map inside his head."
"After he had sent her home, he ate dinner alone at a nearby restaurant: Kyoto-style broiled mackerel with tofu, vinegared vegetables, miso soup, and a bowl of white rice. As usual, he kept away from alcohol. This was <-<-<-<6:30 p.m.>->->->"
"“Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at <-<-<-<6:30>->->-> this evening at 221B Baker Street.”"
At <-<-<-<six-thirty>->->-> I left the bar and walked outside. It was getting dark and the big Avenida looked cool and graceful. On the other side were homes that once looked out on the beach. Now they looked out on hotels and most of them had retreated behind tall hedges and walls that cut them off from the street.
<-<-<-<6.30 p.m.>->->-> Watch television or a video
"As I was turning away, grieved to be parting from him, a thought started up in me and I turned back. ""Shall I take one more message for you?""<br>""That's good of you"" he said, ""but do you want to?""<br>""Yes, just this once."" It could do no harm, I thought; and I should be far away when the message takes effect, and I wanted to say something to show we were friends. ""Well,"" he said, once more across the gap, ""say tomorrow's no good, I'm going to Norwich, but Friday at <-<-<-<half-past six>->->->, same as usual."""
"At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at <-<-<-<half past six>->->-> Elizabeth was summoned to dinner."

"To a casual visitor it might have seemed that Mr. Penicuik, who owned the house, had fallen upon evil days; but two of the three gentlemen assembled in the Saloon at <-<-<-<half-past six>->->-> on a wintry evening of late February were in no danger of falling into this error."
"I said we had better search the house to make sure whether he was there or not, and Mr. Hurst said he would come with me; so we all went over the house and looked in all the rooms, but there was not a sign of Mr. Bellingham in any of them.  Then Mr. Hurst got very nervous and upset, and when he had just snatched a little dinner he ran off to catch the <-<-<-<six thirty-one>->->-> train up to town."""
"“The actions,” Captain Berry relates, “commenced at sunset, which was at <-<-<-<thirty-one minutes past six, p.m.>->->->, with an ardour and vigour which it is impossible to describe."

"She didn’t emerge again until <-<-<-<6:32 p.m.>->->-> She was dressed in her civilian clothes, and headed in the direction of Summers’s flat, stopping on the way to pick up one of his suits from the dry cleaner’s. At 6:58 she let herself into the house."
"Monday <-<-<-<6:32 P.M.>->->-><br>Tanzan Mino was dressed in a black three-quarter sleeved kimono, staring straight ahead as he knelt before the sword resting in front of him. His hands were settled lightly on his thighs, his face expressionless. Then he reached out and touched the scabbard, bowing low to it. Inside was a twelfth-century katana, a five-foot-long razor created by swordsmiths of the Mino School, from the town of Seki, near Gifu in the heart of old Honshu. It was, he believed, a perfect metaphor for Japanese excellence and discipline."
"Every evening, Michel took the train home, changed at Esbly and usually arrived in Crécy on the <-<-<-<6.33 pm>->->-> train where Annabelle would be waiting at the station."
"So now I’m going to leave that old car standing on the tracks at Bridgeboro station, because I have to go downstairs to supper. Oh, boy, I hope the <-<-<-<six thirty-four>->->-> express doesn’t come along and bump into it while I’m eating. I bet you’re all nervous and excited, hey?"
"It is <-<-<-<around half past six>->->-> in the evening. Dusk is gathering in the living room, an early dusk due to the fog which has rolled in from the Sound and is like a white curtain drawn down outside the windows."
I swipe for the time with wet thumbs: <-<-<-<6:35 p.m.>->->-> I’m early. Very early. I’d consider this a good thing if any part of my plan could be called that. I swallow. None of my plan is certain.
And then it was <-<-<-<6.35 p.m.>->->-> and I heard Father come home in his van and I moved the bed up against the door so he couldn't get in and he came into the house and he and Mother shouted at each other.
"Kaldren pursues me like luminescent shadow. He has chalked up on the gateway '96,688,365,498,702'. Should confuse the mail man. Woke 9:05. To sleep <-<-<-<6:36>->->->."
"He checked his watch: <-<-<-<6:37>->->->. The first lot was due to come under the hammer at seven o’clock. He knew exactly how long it would take to walk from the Ritz to Christie’s, and as the Raphael was lot 25, he wasn’t in any hurry."
Amy: What's that? I thought I saw someone pass the window. What time is it?<br>Charles: <-<-<-<Nearly twenty to seven>->->->.
"Come to the Gray's-Inn Coffee-House, Pinto said, ""and I will tell you how the notch came to the ax."" And we walked down Holborn at about <-<-<-<thirty-seven minutes past six o'clock>->->->."
"He took the same route every day, spoke to the same security guard for the same amount of time, took the same lift to the same floor, hung his same coat in the same place and sat at the same desk until lunchtime, when he brought the same sandwich (ham and pickle on brown) from the same sandwich shop. At half past five every day he did the whole journey in reverse, reaching home at between 18:24 on a good day and <-<-<-<18:38>->->-> on a bad one."
"At <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes to seven>->->->, Yuri will sit down at your table, or maybe at the one next to it. That will obviously depend on how busy the cafe is."
"It was <-<-<-<six-forty>->->-> on the same Tuesday before George Chandler-Powell had finished his list of private patients at St. Angela's Hospital. Pulling off his operating gown, he felt paradoxically both exhausted and restless."
"Having to change 'buses, I allowed plenty of time — in fact, too much; for we arrived at <-<-<-<twenty minutes to seven>->->->, and Franching, so the servant said, had only just gone up to dress."
"He made it to Grand Central well in advance. Stillman's train was not due to arrive until <-<-<-<six forty-one>->->->, but Quinn wanted time to study the geography of the place, to make sure that Stillman would not be able to slip away from him."
It was <-<-<-<six forty-two>->->->. Unless Emma was spending the weekend out of town she would probably be at home.
"Bev was no clock-watcher, but by <-<-<-<18.43>->->-> she'd had enough. A stack of papers at her left elbow represented eliminations: calls put in, checks made, follow-ups done and dusted. At the right lay further actions."
"The black boy’s dwarf head swivels and comes nose to knuckle with that hand. He frowns at it, then takes a quick check where’s the other two black boys just in case, and tells McMurphy they don’t open the cabinet till <-<-<-<six-forty-five>->->->. “It’s a policy,” he says."
"Let me see now. You had a drink at the Continental at six ten.<br>""Yes.""<br>""And at <-<-<-<six forty-five>->->-> you were talking to another journalist at the door of the Majestic?""<br>""Yes, Wilkins. I told you all this, Vigot, before. That night."""
"<-<-<-<Six forty-five>->->->, called Louie. ""Did you hear, Ming,"" he asked, ""did you hear?""<br>""Yes, Taddy, I heard.""<br>""What is it?"" asked Tommy. ""The new baby, listen, the new baby."""
It was a <-<-<-<quarter to seven>->->-> when I let myself into the office and clicked the light on and picked a piece of paper off the floor. It was a notice from the Green Feather Messenger Service ...
"When I heard the thump overhead, I did not bother to look up. I knew it was <-<-<-<fourteen minutes to seven>->->->."
"“Should he fail to make an appearance,” Lamont added, his tone changing, “the Hawk’s orders couldn’t have been clearer. Abort. We’re not going to raid Faulkner’s house unless we can be sure the evidence we need to convict him has been delivered.”<br>“No pressure,” whispered Jackie as William checked his watch: <-<-<-<18:47>->->->."
"The clock said <-<-<-<6:47 pm>->->->. With growing fear, I walked stiffly around the apartment, turning on all the lights - even the overhead lights in the living room, which we generally didn’t use because they were so stark and bright."
"We were soon dashing quickly along the streets. I did not know Liverpool well, and consequently could not tell exactly where the man was going. When I got into the hansom it wanted <-<-<-<twelve minutes to seven o'clock>->->->; these minutes were quickly flying, and still no station."
"<-<-<-<6:49 p.m.>->->-> Lieutenant-General Tanz escorted by a motorized unit, drove to Corps headquarters"
"Finally a voice said, “Neither Mr. Clifton nor your daughter are on that flight, Mr. Ghuman, and the boarding desk has already closed. Do you want me to check the <-<-<-<18:50>->->-> flight?”"
"At <-<-<-<6:50 that evening>->->->, Lacey stood in the atrium dressed in shorts, a blue tank top, and sturdy tennis shoes, ready for a warm evening of walking about. She stared at the tiny red tree frog crouched on a branch at eye level as tour groups and a never-ending stream of smaller parties trooped around her, all wandering the portions of the zig that Swain had opened to the public for the weekend's open house."
"At <-<-<-<ten minutes to seven>->->-> Dulcie was ready. She looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror. The reflection was satisfactory. The dark blue dress, fitting without a wrinkle, the hat with its jaunty black feather, the but-slightly-soiled gloves--all representing self- denial, even of food itself--were vastly becoming. Dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful, and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders. No gentleman had ever asked her out before. Now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show."
"It was time to go see the Lady. When we arrived at her house at <-<-<-<ten minutes before seven>->->-> o'clock, Damaronde answered the door."
The square of light in the kitchen doorway had faded to thin purple; his watch said <-<-<-<6:51>->->->.
"As they passed the common a quick glance at the clock in the Town Hall gave them the time. It was just <-<-<-<eight minutes to seven>->->->.<br>“You’ll be cold,” said Tom, as he noted that Willard had no overcoat on.<br>“No, I won’t; not very. There wasn’t time to find anything.” Willard dropped his voice. “How badly is he hurt, Tom?”"
"We've missed the train! It's ten —<-<-<-<eight— minutes to seven>->->->, said Arthur, in a voice which combined reproach and terror. And he sprang out of bed and began with hysteric fury to sort out his garments."
"It was <-<-<-<near on seven o'clock>->->-> when I got to Mr. and Mrs. Fleming's house on 6th Street, where I was renting a room. It was late September, and though there was some sun left, I didn't want to visit a dead man's place with night coming on."
"“Suit yourself. This is Liberty Hall. We ain’t got any rules.” He looked at his watch. “That clock on the mantel there is four minutes fast. It’s <-<-<-<seven minutes to seven>->->-> by the right time. We’re having dinner at half-past seven, but you can come down just as soon as you feel like it.”"
He strolled across the tarmac to the waiting plane <-<-<-<a few minutes after six-fifty>->->->. The plane carrying the icon would be touching down in Washington in about two hours.
"<-<-<-<About seven o’clock>->->-> in the evening she had died, and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill West, whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life. Friends had held him when he drew a stiletto, but West departed amidst his inhuman shrieks, curses, and oaths of vengeance."
"I feel a little awkward, Kay Randall said on the phone, ""asking a man to do these errands ... but that's my problem, not yours. Just bring the supplies and try to be at the church meeting room <-<-<-<a few minutes before seven>->->->."""
"... You had no reason to think the times important. Indeed how suspicious it would be if you had been completely accurate.<br>""Haven't I been?""<br>""Not quite. It was <-<-<-<five to seven>->->-> that you talked to Wilkins.""<br>""Another ten minutes."""
"The play was set to begin at seven o'clock and finish before sunset. It was <-<-<-<6:55>->->->. Beyond the flats we could hear the hockey field filling up. the low rumble got steadily louder - voices, footsteps, the creaking of bleachers, the slamming of car doors in the parking lot."
"Then it was <-<-<-<6.56>->->->. A black Rover - a Rover 90, registration PYX 520 - turned into the street that ran down the left-hand side of The Bunker. It parked. The door on the driver's side opened. A man got out."
"Folded in this triple melody, the audience sat gazing; and beheld gently and approvingly without interrogation, for it seemed inevitable, a box tree in a green tub take the place of the ladies’ dressing-room; while on what seemed to be a wall, was hung a great clock face; the hands pointing to <-<-<-<three minutes to the hour; which was seven>->->->."
"Exactly where he’d seen the two figures, the time at which they continued up the mountain, and the fact that they appeared to be in no difficulty as they disappeared into the mist. When he’d finished, he checked his watch: <-<-<-<6:58 P.M.>->->->"
"She didn’t emerge again until 6:32 p.m. She was dressed in her civilian clothes, and headed in the direction of Summers’s flat, stopping on the way to pick up one of his suits from the dry cleaner’s. At <-<-<-<6:58>->->-> she let herself into the house."
"Walk fast, says Perry, ""it's <-<-<-<two minutes to seven>->->->, and I got to be home by—""<br>""Oh, shut up,"" says I. ""I had an appointment as chief performer at an inquest at seven, and I'm not kicking about not keeping it."""
"Today was Tuesday, the fifteenth of August; the sun had risen at eleven minutes past five this morning and would set at <-<-<-<two minutes before seven>->->-> this evening."
"At <-<-<-<one minute to seven>->->->, Lieutenant Colonel Robertson marched up on to the stage, and everyone else in the room quickly fell silent and sprang to attention. He stopped in the center of the stage and waved the men down."
"At <-<-<-<6:59 p.m.>->->-> Central Standard Time, I stand in my Sunday best in Clare’s vestibule with my finger on her buzzer, fragrant yellow freesia and an Australian Cabernet in my other arm, and my heart in my mouth."
"“It was about <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> and so still I felt that, if someone had spoken a mile away, I could have answered him.”"
By <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> the candles were lit.
"At <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> Holly is still in her office, going over invoices that don’t really need her attention."
"Anne made her way across the dooryard, trailing a steadying hand along the side of Bobbi’s truck. When she had passed the truck, she reached at once for the porch railing. She looked up, and in the slanting light of <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->, Gardener thought the woman looked both aged and ageless."
"On se réunit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se sépare. Everyone does as he pleases till dinnertime. Dinner at <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->."
"By <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->, all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane."
"Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->. If you are distrustful bring two friends. You are a wronged woman and shall have justice. Do not bring the police. If you do, all will be in vain.<br>-Your unknown friend."
"The clocks were chiming <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->. ""Ah Mr. Lipwig,"" said Lord Vetinari, looking up. ""Thank you so much for dropping in. It has been such a busy day, has it not? Drumknott, do help Mr. Lipwig to a chair. Prophecy can be very exhausting, I believe."""
"Billy closes his eyes and goes to sleep.<br>At <-<-<-<seven>->->-> that evening, he’s eating a room service dinner and watching The Asphalt Jungle on his laptop. It’s a jinxed one last job picture, for sure. The phone rings. It’s Ken Hoff. He tells Billy where they’ll meet tomorrow afternoon. Billy doesn’t have to write it down. Writing things down can be dangerous, and he’s got a good memory."
"“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.<br>“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at <-<-<-<seven sharp>->->-> for dinner.”"
"In his hotel room at the Bon Voyage, Dr. Rufus Sixsmith reads a sheaf of letters written to him nearly half a century ago by his friend Robert Frobisher. Sixsmith knows them by heart, but their texture, rustle, and his friend’s faded handwriting calm his nerves. These letters are what he would save from a burning building. At <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> precisely, he washes, changes his shirt, and sandwiches the nine read letters in the Gideon’s Bible—this he replaces in the bedside cabinet. Sixsmith slips the unread letters into his jacket pocket for the restaurant."
"“Very glad to see you. I dine at <-<-<-<seven>->->->. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.”"
"By <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums."
"“Yes, <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->->. I will bring dessert.” Smiling in her sad-happy way, she hobbled back into her unit while I continued to mine."
"“What? No. I mean, yeah, that’s when we have to be in the lot, but there’s a bunch of stuff before, you know, costumes, makeup, all that. I usually get there at <-<-<-<seven>->->->. I can’t believe nobody told you any of this.”"
"After that first night, Kendra quickly fell into a rhythm: She’d drive in with Sarah, arrive by <-<-<-<seven P.M.>->->->, punch in immediately, sift through the costumes, splatter herself with blood, go through makeup if needed, and walk with Christy and Sarah down to the lot."
"“It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> for your first training session."""
"At <-<-<-<seven o’clock>->->-> precisely, a tiny Italian man entered James’s office. He was wearing a very ancient tuxedo and a white bow tie, which was almost exactly the same size and shape as the mustache on his upper lip."
"… in a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all its possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary .. to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and as though there had been no time there but <-<-<-<seven o'clock>->->-> at night."
"The town clock struck <-<-<-<seven>->->->. The echoes of the great chime wandered in the unlit halls of the library. An autumn leaf, very crisp, fell somewhere in the dark. But it was only the page of a book, turning."
<-<-<-<7.00 p.m.>->->-> Do maths practice
"Edward had been allowed to see me only from <-<-<-<seven>->->-> till nine-thirty pm, always inside the confines of my home and under the supervision of my dad's unfailingly crabby glare."
"It was <-<-<-<seven o'clock>->->-> and by this time she was not very far from Raveloe, but she was not familiar enough with those monotonous lanes to know how near she was to her journey's end. She needed comfort, and she knew but one comforter - the familiar demon in her bosom; but she hesitated a moment, after drawing out the black remnant, before she raised it to her lips."
It was <-<-<-<seven o'clock>->->-> when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island. [...] So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.
"The gates of the cemetary were closed at sundown; sundown took place that night at <-<-<-<one minute past seven>->->->, and the distance into town is considerable."
"He waited until nearly eight, because <-<-<-<around seven>->->-> there were always more people coming in and out of the house than at other times."
"When Teddy Carella walkied into the squad room at <-<-<-<two minutes past seven>->->->, Peter Byrnes thought he would have a heart attack."
"Twas <-<-<-<about seven o'clock>->->-> at night,<br>And the wind it blew with all its might,<br>And the rain came pouring down,<br>And the dark clouds seem'd to frown,"
There was trouble with the track. No one could give any idea when it would be put right. The train arriving at <-<-<-<three minutes past seven>->->-> had been the last one in. Were all the gods of travel conspiring to thwart him?
"Sunday evening at almost the same hour (to be precise, at about <-<-<-<7:04 p.m.>->->->) she rings the front door bell at the home of Walter Moeding, Crime Commissioner, who is at that moment engaged, for professional rather than private reasons, in disguising himself as a sheikh."
"I parked at a rental lot outside O'Hare about <-<-<-<five minutes after seven>->->->. I got out of the car with my staff and rod in hand. There was only one old light burning on the lot, but the moon had risen huge and bright, and I had no trouble seeing Micheal coming."
"It was <-<-<-<five past seven>->->->, a little past his normal time, when Hubert got back to the flat which he supposed he ought now to call home, but in which he still felt as ill at ease as a guest who is beginning to suspect that he has outstayed his welcome."
"Punctual as always, Monsignor Kevin Sullivan was in the chandeliered lobby of the Hilton at <-<-<-<7:05 p.m.>->->->, when Jon and Shannon stepped off the elevator. This time nattily attired in clerical grays, the dark-haired, ruddy-faced son of Ireland gracefully kissed Shannon's hand and then squeezed Jon's."
"The time on the clock was six minutes after seven p.m. That doesn't conclusively prove that Sam Dillon was murdered at <-<-<-<seven-oh-six p.m.>->->->, but all other evidence would certainly corroborate that point."
"Qantas Flight 102 touched down at Melbourne Airport at <-<-<-<seven minutes past seven>->->->. Charlie was the first off the aircraft, running as fast as he could, but having to lug Cathy’s picture under one arm slowed him down and made it possible for several other passengers, who obviously had the same idea, to overtake him."
"She fell into unconsciousness and so remained two days and five hours, until Tuesday evening at <-<-<-<seven minutes past seven>->->->, when the release came. She was twenty-four years and five months old."
It was <-<-<-<eight minutes past seven>->->-> and still no girl. I waited impatiently. I watched another crowd surge through the barriers and move quickly down the steps. My eyes were alert for the faintest recognition.
Wallander was lucky and managed to catch a taxi right outside. When he got to Rosengard it was <-<-<-<nine minutes past seven>->->->. He hoped that Mona was running late. But when he read the note on the door he realised that this was not the case.
A taxi drew up outside her former marital home at <-<-<-<7:10 p.m.>->->-> Alex appeared a few moments later. He was wearing a dinner jacket boasting three campaign medals.
"Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on the wall that it was <-<-<-<ten minutes past seven>->->->. He had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the other side."
"It was <-<-<-<7.10>->->-> and the saloon bar of the Duke of Clarence club was already smoke-filled, the noise level rising and the crowd at the bar three feet deep. Christine Baldwin, the Whistler's fifth victim, had exactly twenty minutes to live."
"A warm breeze came through the window, smelling of freshly cut grass. The landlord was now mowing the patch of green lawn with a push mower. I glanced at my wristwatch. It was <-<-<-<7:10 p.m.>->->->"
"He had already got to the point where, by rocking more strongly, he maintained his equilibrium with difficulty, and very soon he would finally have to make a final decision, for <-<-<-<in five minutes it would be a quarter past seven>->->->. Then there was a ring at the door of the apartment.<br>“That’s someone from the office,” he told himself, and he almost froze, while his small limbs only danced around all the faster. For one moment everything remained still. “They aren’t opening,” Gregor said to himself, caught up in some absurd hope."
"The party was to begin at seven. The invitations gave the hour as six-thirty because the family knew everyone would come a little late, so as not to be the first to arrive. At <-<-<-<seven-ten>->->-> not a soul had come; somewhat acrimoniously, the family discussed the advantages and disadvantages of tardiness"
"Good, you said. Run, or you won't get a seat. See you soon. Your voice was reassuring. <-<-<-<19:11>->->->:00, the clock said. I put the phone back on its hook and I ran. The seat I got, almost the last one in the carriage, was opposite a girl who started coughing as soon as there weren't any other free seats I could move to. She looked pale and the cough rattled deep in her chest as she punched numbers into her mobile. Hi, she said (cough). I'm on the train. No, I've got a cold. A cold (cough). Yeah, really bad. Yeah, awful actually. Hello? (cough) Hello?"
"At <-<-<-<twelve minutes past seven>->->->, in the kitchen, Kimberly was becoming anxious."
"He taught me that if I had to meet someone for an appointment, I must refuse to follow the ""stupid human habit"" of arbitrarily choosing a time based on fifteen-minute intervals. ""Never meet people at 7:45 or 6:30, Jasper, but pick times like <-<-<-<7:12>->->-> and 8:03!"""
"The train arrived at Kizil Arvat, two hundred and forty-two versts from the Caspian, at <-<-<-<thirteen minutes past seven>->->-> in the evening instead of seven o'clock. The slight delay provoked thirteen objurgations from the baron, one for each minute."
"If he'd lived in New York and worked in an office, he might have thrived as the typical, over-martini'd, cheating husband, leaving every night on the <-<-<-<7:14>->->-> to White Plains, a smudge of lipstick high on his neck, and a tide of lies to see him through to the next day."
"“Your holiness,” he called.<br>“Well?”<br>“The horses are here; it’s time for the evening service.”<br>“What o’clock is it?”<br>“A <-<-<-<quarter past seven>->->->.”"
"The raft drifted steadily north. “There must be a current.” The current was carrying them north, toward the hotel. He looked at his watch and was astonished to see it was <-<-<-<fifteen minutes past seven>->->->. Only fifteen minutes had passed since he had last looked at his watch. It seemed like two hours."
"It was on the busy, dirty Anerley Road in South London that the man hit me. It was the nineteenth of September, it was around <-<-<-<quarter past seven in the evening>->->->, and I was walking downhill from the train station to our flat after a shift at the bookshop. The weather had been fine in the morning when I set out for work, but now it was raining and I wasn’t dressed for it."
"At <-<-<-<7:15 p.m.>->->-> and nine seconds, Prager called Eva’s cell, and once again it went straight to VM. He tried her apartment, and no one answered; a machine didn’t even pick up."
"Cell count down to 400,000. Woke 8:10. To sleep <-<-<-<7:15>->->->. (Appear to have lost my watch without realising it, had to drive into town to buy another.)"
"Nick had a large wild plan of his own for the night, but for now he let Leo take charge: they were going to go back to Notting Hill and catch the <-<-<-<seven fifteen>->->-> screening of Scarface at the Gate."
"The party was to begin at seven. The invitations gave the hour as six-thirty because the family knew everyone would come a little late, so as not to be the first to arrive. . . By <-<-<-<seven-fifteen>->->-> not another soul could squeeze into the house."
"AT <-<-<-<7:16 P.M.>->->->, LEAPMAN switched the light off in his office and stepped into the corridor. He closed his door but didn’t lock it. He walked toward the bank of elevators, aware that the only office light still shining was coming from under the chairman’s door."
“<-<-<-<Sixteen past seven PM>->->->? That's when he came into the store or when he left after the fact?”
<-<-<-<7:17 p.m.>->->-> Simon is coming round. His girlfriend has gone back to her husband. Thank God stayed at home to receive chucked friends in manner of Queen of Hearts or Soup Kitchen. But that's just the kind of person I am: liking to love others.
"Colonel Putnis knocked on his door at <-<-<-<7.17 p.m.>->->-> The car was waiting in front of the hotel, and they drove through the dark streets to police headquarters. It had grown much colder during the evening, and the city was almost deserted."
"It's now exactly <-<-<-<eighteen minutes past seven>->->->, according to Mr. Cartier.<br>It was still raining outside; but a taxi drove up and a couple got out and the doorman protected Gretchen with a big umbrella as she ran for the cab."
"And it was me who spent about three hours this afternoon arguing one single contract. The term was best endeavors. The other side wanted to use reasonable efforts. In the end we won the point- but I can't feel my usual triumph. All I know is, it's <-<-<-<seven-nineteen>->->->, and in eleven minutes I'm supposed to be halfway across town, sitting down to dinner at Maxim's with my mother and brother Daniel. I'll have to cancel. My own birthday dinner."
"Two million dollars had been delivered to Lindstrom's home on Grace Cove at <-<-<-<seven-twenty P.M.>->->-> It had come in large bundles of hundred-dollar bills, packed in two large metal cases, and accompanied by Lucky Knudsen and three additional state troopers."
"What is interesting and important is that the caller had some difficulty getting through, either genuine or contrived. As a result we know the operator reported the time of the call: <-<-<-<twenty minutes past seven>->->->."
"The next Friday he watched to see if they would come again. They did, and at the same times, the woman first, at <-<-<-<twenty minutes past seven>->->->, the boy forty minutes later."
"I'd love to, but if I went horizontal, it would be all over. I have to stay awake for Sean's call. Grant checked the clock, which told him it was <-<-<-<7:20 PM>->->->. ""He's actually a bit late."""
Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets. The clock’s hands said <-<-<-<seven-twenty>->->->: it was nineteen-twenty really.
"The clock read <-<-<-<seven-twenty>->->->, but I felt no hunger. You'd think I might have wanted to eat something after the day I'd had, but I cringed at the very thought of food. I was short of sleep, my gut was slashed, and my apartment was gutted. There was no room for appetite."
"The pause, we finally concluded, was to allow the other important people to catch up, those who had arrived at 7:10 waiting for those who had arrived at <-<-<-<7:20>->->->."
"Gripping her gym bag in her right hand, Aomame, like Buzzcut, was waiting for something to happen. The clock display changed to <-<-<-<7:21>->->->, then 7:22, then 7:23."
"Gripping her gym bag in her right hand, Aomame, like Buzzcut, was waiting for something to happen. The clock display changed to 7:21, then <-<-<-<7:22>->->->, then 7:23."
"Cavalli checked his watch: <-<-<-<7:22>->->->. When he looked up he saw Johnny heading towards him, red in the face. Thank God I don’t have to work in Hollywood, thought Cavalli."
"It was <-<-<-<7:22 p.m.>->->-> by the wall clock when he soldered the final connection. Eric estimated a half hour delay before the little generator had taken over, put the time actually at near eight o'clock. He found himself hesitant, strangely unwilling to test the completed machine."
"BRYCE FENSTON’S GULFSTREAM V executive jet touched down at Heathrow at <-<-<-<7:22 P.M.>->->->, and Ruth was standing on the tarmac waiting to greet the bank’s representative. She had already alerted customs with all the relevant details so that the paperwork could be completed just as soon as Anna returned."
"Gripping her gym bag in her right hand, Aomame, like Buzzcut, was waiting for something to happen. The clock display changed to 7:21, then 7:22, then <-<-<-<7:23>->->->."
"He will probably return with Mrs. Dashwood, she said, ""for early this morning he sent a telegram so that she take the ten-thirty-five train from Chicago, which will arrive here at <-<-<-<seven-twenty-four>->->->. Is there any news of Mr. Dashwood?"" she added, her motherly face betraying keen anxiety."
He picked up his hat and coat and Clarice said hello to him and he said hello and looked at the clock and it was <-<-<-<almost twenty-five after seven>->->->.
"When the bishop led the three men on to the stage at <-<-<-<7:25 p.m.>->->->, it was the only time that night when everyone in the hall applauded. Giles took his seat and looked down at the packed audience. He estimated that over a thousand members of the public had turned up to watch the jousting."
"No, sir, only the housekeeper. He's been in New England visiting his daughter. He always goes there in the fall. He was due back at the Heathrow on BA flight 214 arriving at <-<-<-<seven twenty-five>->->->."
"He tried one more time at <-<-<-<7:25>->->->, and nothing had changed. It ran and ran, eleven, twelve, thirteen times.<br>He threw his guitar in his dad’s car and drove south toward Prescott. The Built to Spill tape was still in the tape deck, and he just let it keep going; it might as well be the damn soundtrack to everything."
He picked up his hat and coat and Clarice said hello to him and he said hello and looked at the clock and it was almost <-<-<-<twenty-five after seven>->->->.
"Newman pointed up at the hotel. Under the eaves shards of ice a foot long projected downwards. A palisade of icicles. Inverted. The station was little more than a one-storey hut, an isolated building with no one about. The dashboard clock registered <-<-<-<19.26 hours>->->->."
The pilot welcomed them aboard and warned them there might be a slight delay. Dexter checked his watch: <-<-<-<7:27>->->->. He began drumming his fingers on the armrest that divided him from Scott.
"He may as well give it a go, at least once. If it was as bad as he was anticipating, he need never return. He turned into the college car park at <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past seven>->->-> precisely."
"As you know, we're on twenty-four hour call and I got here at <-<-<-<seven twenty-eight>->->->. We decided to start the investigation at once. The undertakers will collect the body as soon as you've finished."
"It says here that you called your mother at <-<-<-<7:28>->->-> p.m. this evening.<br>""There's some sort of mistake. I didn't get the chance to call anyone."""
"I expect she didn't want Octavia to know that she'd called in her father, not until they'd worked out a plan. And I was the one who fixed the time. I didn't see how I could catch a train before the seventeen-twenty-two which gets in to Waterloo at <-<-<-<nineteen-twenty-nine>->->->."
"Everybody turns in his chair and watches that butter sneak on down the wall, starting, hanging still, shooting ahead and leaving a shiny trail behind it on the pane. Nobody says a word. They look at the butter, then at the clock, then back at the butter. The clock’s moving now.<br>The butter makes it down to the floor about a half <-<-<-<minute before seven-thirty>->->->, and McMurphy gets back all the money he lost."
"When the news was over, Anderson told Gardener she was going to bed.<br>“At <-<-<-<seven-thirty>->->->?”<br>“I’m still bushed.” And she looked it."
"At <-<-<-<seven-thirty>->->->, Chetta Reynolds blew into the examining room where the Stones and their ceaselessly screaming baby daughter had been stashed. The poet rumored to be on the short list for Presidential Medal of Freedom was dressed in straight-leg jeans and a BU sweatshirt with a hole in one elbow."
"I could see her eyeing the sweaty bottle of rosé. “Come out with me tonight, pretty please? My friend Jackie from Pilates is having a birthday party at a gay bar in the Village. I wasn’t going to go, but if you come with me it could be fun. It’s only <-<-<-<seven thirty>->->->. And it’s Friday night. Let’s drink this and go out. The night is young!”<br>“I’m tired, Reva,” I said, peeling the wrapper off the cap of a bottle of NyQuil."
"<-<-<-<Seven-thirty>->->-> back to the day room. The Big Nurse looks out through her special glass, always polished till you can’t tell it’s there, and nods at what she sees, reaches up and tears a sheet off her calendar one day closer to the goal."
"Everybody turns in his chair and watches that butter sneak on down the wall, starting, hanging still, shooting ahead and leaving a shiny trail behind it on the pane. Nobody says a word. They look at the butter, then at the clock, then back at the butter. The clock’s moving now.<br>The butter makes it down to the floor about a half minute before <-<-<-<seven-thirty>->->->, and McMurphy gets back all the money he lost."
"But now he was close - here was the house, here were the gates. Somewhere a clock beat a single chime. ""What, is it really <-<-<-<half-past seven>->->->? That's impossible, it must be fast!"""
"On July 25th, 8:30 a.m. the bitch Novaya dies whelping. At 10 o'clock she is lowered into her cool grave, at <-<-<-<7:30>->->-> that same evening we see our first floes and greet them wishing they were the last."
"The clock showed <-<-<-<half-past seven>->->->. This was the twilight time. He would be there now. I pictured him in his old navy-blue sweater and peaked cap, walking soft-footed up the track towards the wood. He told me he wore the sweater because navy-blue barely showed up in the dark, black was even better, he said. The peaked cap was important too, he explained, because the peak casts a shadow over one's face."
"The telephone call came at <-<-<-<7.30>->->-> on the evening of March 18th, a Saturday, the eve of the noisy, colourful festival that the town held in honour of Saint Joseph the carpenter -"
"At <-<-<-<half past seven>->->-> in the evening, and consequently after supping instead of before, as I should have preferred, he took twenty-five grains of the drug."
"<-<-<-<7:31 P.M.>->->-><br>As another gust hit, Vance glanced up at the rigging, praying it would hang together. Instead of canvas, the wide, shallow square sail was made of small linen cloths sewn together, like those made on the tiny looms of ancient times. It was a single-masted reefing sail, invented just in time for the Trojan War, with an upper yard fitted with a system of lines whereby it could be furled up and then secured aloft."
"It’s <-<-<-<7:32 p.m.>->->->, and Marge sits beside Clay on one side of the interrogation room table. Luke and I sit opposite them. We’ve run through the preambles. The interview is being recorded."
"At <-<-<-<thirty-three minutes past seven>->->-> he stood on the platform of the station at Southampton - a clear hour before the train containing Owen could possibly arrive. Making a few inquiries here, but too impatient to pursue his investigation carefully and inductively, he went into the town."
"“You better not wait up, because if I fail, Simon, I’ll probably jump on top of you.”<br>“Thanks for the warning, Mark. Tough it out, man.”<br>Beautiful evening, climb into car, check watch: <-<-<-<7:34>->->->."
"I checked my watch at <-<-<-<19:34>->->-> and thought that would be unfortunate, wouldn't it, if Pepperidge finally called me and heard only the engaged tone while Al was asking about his girlfriend's health or his aunt's or whoever the hell it was on the other end, my chest's easier but there's still this cough, and the doctor says I do not care what the doctor says, just get off the line."
"“We’ve only got one chance of getting across that border,” said Scott, “so for now pull over into that clump of trees. We can’t risk going out onto the highway until it’s pitch dark.” He checked the time. It was <-<-<-<7:35>->->->."
"George checked his watch: <-<-<-<7:35 P.M.>->->-> By now Geoffrey Young would be taking the rest of the team through tomorrow’s program, having informed them who would be joining him on the final ascent. The water boiled."
"At <-<-<-<seven-thirty-five P.M.>->->->, Cork parked his Bronco behind the Aurora Middle School and headed toward the back entrance, which was near a Dumpster. He could see that Deputy Gil Singer had been posted at the door."
"Trying to identify the key facts, Ethan was suddenly aware he was looking at the wall clock; it was <-<-<-<7:35>->->->.<br>“Wait a minute. When did you hear about this?”<br>There was a tiny moment of hesitation. “The first news came in just before five.”"
"<-<-<-<7.35>->->->-40. Yseut arrives at 'M. and S.', puts through phone call."
The time on the video recorder was <-<-<-<19.36>->->-> when the back door slammed and Victor strode into the front room clutching a handful of something so unspeakably vile it defies description.
A ship is making an unauthorized departure from the main orbital terminal tonight at precisely <-<-<-<19:37>->->-> hours. We need to produce a reaction from Orbital Defense which will appear to be a genuine response to an unauthorized seizure of a vessel.
"Wednesday <-<-<-<7:38 P.M.>->->-><br>""Michael! And Eva!  Again, after so long. Pos iste! What a surprise!"" The old Greek's sunburned face widened into a smile, his gray mustache opening above his last good teeth. ""Parakalo, you must come in for a glass of raki and some of Adriana's meze. She would never forgive me."""
"At <-<-<-<7:39>->->-> the aircraft taxied onto the runway to prepare for takeoff. When it stopped, Dexter asked the flight attendant what was holding them up."
The time too was speeding on. <-<-<-<Twenty-one minutes to eight>->->->! In a few minutes more he must set out or he would miss the train.
"<-<-<-<7:39 P.M.>->->-><br>Eva and Braque made $180 at Jack Cermak’s before complains from the nosy wait staff and whiny-ass sore losers forced them out. Then they made a quick five bucks at the famous Every 1’s A Wiener hot dog stand in Andersonville just for taking a bite from a Fire Dog. Eva actually took two bites, because that’s just who she was."
"They reckon the time was <-<-<-<twenty to eight>->->->. They can swear, sir, that the body wasn't suspended then and that they saw no one on the forecourt."
"She arrives at <-<-<-<7.40>->->->, ten minutes late, but the children, Jimmy and Bitsy, are still eating supper and their parents are not ready to go yet. From other rooms come the sound of a baby screaming, water running, a television musical (no words: probably a dance number - patterns of gliding figures come to mind)."
LIGHTING-UP TIME WAS <-<-<-<7:41 P.M.>->->-> on September 25th. Krantz didn’t appear on the outskirts of Wentworth until just after eight.
"Do you expect to make an arrest? What's to stop this woman from leaving the country?<br>""Up to now, I'm afraid nothing."" And since they knew there wasn't a train until <-<-<-<7:41>->->-> in the evening, they had all dashed off to the airport in Pisa."
"He entered the saleroom at <-<-<-<7:42>->->->, and took his reserved seat, which he’d selected after some considerable thought. Three rows from the back on the left-hand side. He’d even practiced raising his paddle just high enough for the auctioneer to spot him without anyone in front of him having any idea who was bidding."
"It was <-<-<-<7:42>->->->, just over an hour since he had rung Frances. She should have arrived by now."
"So he really had no choice but to pay an occasional visit to the living room instead, where the hands on the grandfather clock now indicated, rather unambiguously, that it was <-<-<-<7:42>->->->"
"“I had been in the tech ninja sleeve only a few hours—<-<-<-<seven, and forty-two minutes>->->-> according to the time display chipped into my upper-left field of vision—but there were none of the usual download side effects.”"
"I glance at my watch as we speed along the Strand. <-<-<-<Seven forty-two>->->->. I'm starting to feel quite excited. The street outside is still bright and warm and tourists are walking along in T-shirts and shorts, pointing at the High Court. It must have been a gorgeous summer's day. Inside the air-conditioned Carter Spink building you have no idea what the weather in the real world is doing."
"He glanced up at the clock on the corner of his desk: <-<-<-<7:43 P.M.>->->-> “Shit,” he said, aware that if he didn’t hurry he was going to be late for his own speech at the bankers’ dinner."
"In response to a hail from within the wall, several of the warders bent to the windlass, whereupon the portcullis scraped and groaned aloft, and the tall knight came riding out just as the hands of Mallory's timepiece registered <-<-<-<7:43 p.m.>->->->"
"<-<-<-<7:44 P.M.>->->-><br>Vance watched as the Hind approached on the starboard side of the destroyer, heading straight for it and dropping altitude. What in hell was going on?"
"I imagine so. He died at night, or he was last seen alive by Grace Willson at <-<-<-<7:45 p.m.>->->-> when he heard her confession. I suppose he died of boredom."
"At <-<-<-<quarter to eight in the evening>->->->, Emmett was sitting in a run-down saloon at the edge of Manhattan with a glass of beer and a photograph of Harrison Hewett on the bar in front of him."
"“There will call upon you to-night, at <-<-<-<a quarter to eight o’clock>->->->,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”"
"<-<-<-<Seven-forty-five>->->-> the black boys move down the line of Chronics taping catheters on the ones that will hold still for it. Catheters are second-hand condoms the ends clipped off and rubber-banded to tubes that run down pantlegs to a plastic sack marked DISPOSABLE NOT TO BE RE-USED, which it is my job to wash out at the end of each day."
"Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the Bergs’ house, not at ten but at <-<-<-<fifteen minutes to eight>->->->."
"He taught me that if I had to meet someone for an appointment, I must refuse to follow the ""stupid human habit"" of arbitrarily choosing a time based on fifteen-minute intervals. ""Never meet people at <-<-<-<7:45>->->-> or 6:30, Jasper, but pick times like 7:12 and 8:03!"""
"He tells his old friend the train times and they settle on the <-<-<-<19.45>->->-> arriving at 23.27. ""I'll book us into the ultra-luxurious Francis Drake Lodge. Running water in several rooms. Have you got a mobile?"""
"<-<-<-<7:46 P.M.>->->-><br>""Right."" Alfred Konwitz snapped to attention. ""Yes, sir.""<br>He slammed down the phone and whirled around to Jack Mulhoney. ""Full denial, sir. Israeli Control says they have no military aircraft operating anywhere in that sector of the Aegean."""
"<-<-<-<7:47 P.M.>->->-><br>Vance watched as the frigate got off a warning tracer, but to no effect. The Hind ignored it, as a stream of 57mm rockets from under the chopper's stubby starboard wing flared down, while the radar-slaved machine gun beneath the nose opened fire."
"On the ride down in the elevator, Fenston was fascinated to see the low estimate for Caillebotte’s Street Sweepers. He had acquired the larger version for half that price from a client he had recently bankrupted. When the doors slid open, he walked quickly across to reception and signed himself out: <-<-<-<7:48 P.M.>->->->"
"<-<-<-<7:48 P.M.>->->-><br>There are sounds of doors opening and closing, with whispered words that are like alien hisses. She senses she is in motion, on a bed that is gliding past powerful overhead lights."
"When did you next see Dr. Wellesley?<br>""At just <-<-<-<eleven minutes to eight>->->->.""<br>""Where?""<br>""In the surgery.""<br>""He came back there?""<br>""Yes.""<br>""How do you fix that precise time--eleven minutes to eight?""<br>""Because he'd arranged to see a patient in Meadow Gate at ten minutes to eight. I glanced at the clock as he came in, saw what time it was, and reminded him of the appointment."""
"<-<-<-<Eleven minutes to eight>->->->.<br>""You're always right; there must be a clock in your head.""<br>""I can't be wrong, tonight. I'll be able to tell you one second before they blast off. Look! The ten-minute warning!"""
"Everything was arranged for them. A real limousine came at <-<-<-<ten minutes to eight>->->-> and took them to the theater. It drew up under the marquee at exactly the right time, after the big stars and the director and the author and the governor and the mayor and some less important stars."
The hands of the clock in the middle of the wall were pointing to <-<-<-<ten minutes to eight>->->->. The cafe closed at eight.
"At <-<-<-<ten to eight>->->->, he strolled downstairs, to make sure that Signora Buffi was not pottering around in the hall and that her door was not open, and to make sure there really was no one in Freddie's car"
"Annie somehow managed to shower and change into a cocktail dress, while Fletcher paced around the room looking at his watch every few moments. He opened the cab door for his wife at <-<-<-<7:51>->->->."
"The plane swung around onto the take-off runway at <-<-<-<7:51>->->->, its jets revving before it moved slowly forward, then gathered speed. The wheels left the ground at 7:53."
"He waited until <-<-<-<nearly eight>->->->, because around seven there were always more people coming in and out of the house than at other times. At ten to eight, he strolled downstairs, to make sure that Signora Buffi was not pottering around in the hall and that her door was not open, and to make sure there really was no one in Freddie's car, though he had gone down in the middle of the afternoon to look at the car and see if it was Freddie's."
"<-<-<-<7:52 P.M.>->->-><br>Vance pulled himself across the planking and stretched for a box of gear stowed beneath the stern platform. In it was a constant traveling companion: his chrome-handled 9mm Walther. Although the concept of downing a Hind gunship with small-arms fire had been tested in Afghanistan and found wanting, he was so angry his better judgment was not fully in play."
"The plane swung around onto the take-off runway at 7:51, its jets revving before it moved slowly forward, then gathered speed. The wheels left the ground at <-<-<-<7:53>->->->."
"Wednesday, 11 th December 1963. <-<-<-<7.53 p.m.>->->-> ""Help me. You've got to help me."" The woman's voice quavered on the edge of tears. The duty constable who had picked up the phone heard a hiccuping gulp, as if the caller was struggling to speak."
The body was found at <-<-<-<six minutes to eight>->->->. Doctor Young arrived some thirty minutes later. Just let me get that clear - I've a filthy memory.
It was <-<-<-<seven fifty-five>->->-> and Detective Inspector Kate Miskin and Detective Inspector Piers Tarrant were drinking together in a riverside pub between Southwark Bridge and London Bridge.
"At <-<-<-<five minutes to eight>->->->, the Prime Minister emerged from Wilson’s office, followed by Halifax and Cadogan. Wilson was the last to appear. He looked irritated. Legat guessed he must have had a further argument with Cadogan."
"Flora drew her coat round her, and looked up into the darkening vault of the sky. Then she glanced at her watch. It was <-<-<-<five to eight>->->->."
"The party starts at <-<-<-<eight, and it's five to>->->->.<br>""Anything up to half an hour late is considered on time, Pruitt. Don't you know anything about etiquette?""<br>""Very little, I'm afraid""<br>""Well, anything up to half an hour late is considered on time, but anything before the appointed time---even a single minute---is downright gouchy."""
"I remember the cigarette in his hard face, against the now limitless storm cloud. Bernardo cried to him unexpectedly: ""What time is it, Ireno?""<br>Without consulting the sky, without stopping, he replied: ""It's <-<-<-<four minutes to eight>->->->, young Bernardo Juan Franciso."" His voice was shrill, mocking."
"At <-<-<-<three minutes till eight>->->->, Laszlo and His Yankee Hussars set up onstage. While the band played their Sousa medley, Carter thoroughly checked his kit, stuffing his pockets with scarves, examining the seals on decks of cards. He glanced toward his levitation device. ""Good luck, Carter."" The voice was quiet."
"He had to catch the conspirators alive, get them to testify against the Senator. The Director checked his watch with the clock on the Old Post Office Tower over the Washington Field Office. It was <-<-<-<7:58>->->->."
"He leaped into his car, revving it quickly through the gears, shot along to Sloane Square, through Eaton Square, up past St. George’s Hospital, around Hyde Park Corner into Park Lane, and arrived at <-<-<-<7:58 P.M.>->->->"
Robert Langdon stole an anxious glance at his wristwatch: <-<-<-<7.58 pm>->->->. The smiling face of Mickey Mouse did little to cheer him up.
"It was right at <-<-<-<eight o'clock, maybe a minute before>->->->. I went into the demo room to see if I'd left my tin of polish there. And there was this bottle of milk on the trolley and I drank some of it. Just a bit off the top."
"I see Lil right as I dismount the bike, her silver braid draped across her right shoulder. She sits on the front porch, her soft, weathered skin a rosy hue in the last rays of the day’s sunlight. It’s <-<-<-<teetering on eight o’clock>->->->."
"Kuniang made her appearance in my study <-<-<-<just before eight o' clock>->->->, arrayed in what had once been a ""party frock."""
"Quickly, quickly. <-<-<-<A minute to eight>->->->. My hot water bottle was ready, and I filled a glass with water from the tap. Time was of the essence."
"It was still only <-<-<-<eight o‘clock>->->->. “Missis!” he cried. “We shall get home tonight! We shall be home for Christmas!”<br>“Yes, Pongo,” said Missis gaily. But she did not feel as gay as she sounded."
"Charlie glanced at the clock over the bar and saw it was <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->, but the other men were coming over to talk, and he realized he might not be able to pry his father loose from the gaggle of admirers. Especially if they brought him drinks."
"The ten directors now sitting in the conference room were irritable and impatient. It was <-<-<-<8:00 P.M.>->->-> They had been talking among themselves for the last ten minutes, but slowly had fallen silent."
"On the wall above the cupboard, invisible save at night, by lamplight and even then evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand, a cabinet clock ticked, then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat, struck five times.<br>""<-<-<-<Eight o’clock>->->->,"" Dilsey said."
"“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes, speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him too hard.”<br>“It is <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> now,” I said, glancing at my watch."
"The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.<br>“At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?” I asked.<br>“At <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->,” she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation."
"I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> the apartment was full of cheerful sun."
"Again at <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->->, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible 70 gestures inside."
"<-<-<-<Eight o’clock>->->->, no later, you light the lamps, the big one by the large window, the small one on your desk, they are not to see by— It is still twilight out over the sand, the scrub oaks and cranberries, even the small birds have not settled. For sleep yet, out of the reach of prowling foxes. No, you light the lamps because you are alone in your small house and the wicks sputtering gold are like two visitors with good stories."
"She stared back, surprised and confused. Then defiant. Abruptly she closed the laptop, stuffed it in her bag. She withdrew a pen and scribbled an address on a napkin. “If you change your mind,” she said stiffly, standing, “I will be at this location between <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> and nine o’clock tonight.”"
"It was nearly <-<-<-<8:00 p.m.>->->->, and Sully was glad to see the lights still on. With no Internet service of his own, and the computers at the Gazette being out of the question (he didn’t want anyone to know what he was doing, least of all reporters), this was his best and only option for doing research; a place where he once wrote grade-school book reports."
"<-<-<-<Eight o’clock>->->-> the walls whirr and hum into full swing. The speaker in the ceiling says, “Medications,” using the Big Nurse’s voice."
"“I’ll give you a ride, of course!” Sarah said, slapping Kendra’s shoulder. “It’s really no problem.”<br>Kendra grabbed where she’d been slapped. “We start at <-<-<-<eight>->->->?” she said, kneading her shoulder."
"Then the grandfather’s clock in the hall outside struck <-<-<-<eight>->->->, and the memory of the night before came to him."
“Mr. Owen - unfortunately delayed - unable to get here till tomorrow. Instructions -<br>everything they wanted - if they would like to go to their rooms?… dinner would be at <-<-<-<8 o’clock>->->->…”
"'TIS <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->->, a clear March night, The moon is up, the sky is blue, The owlet, in the moonlight air, Shouts from nobody knows where; He lengthens out his lonely shout, Halloo! halloo! a long halloo!"
"I trace the words, ""I'll arrive to collect you for drinks at <-<-<-<eight>->->-> on Saturday."""
<-<-<-<8.00 p.m.>->->-> Have a bath
"Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->-> and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her."
"At <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->-> that evening, a Saturday, Pamela Chamcha stood with Jumpy Joshi - who had refused to let her go unaccompanied - next to the Photo-Me machine in a corner of the main concourse of Euston station, feeling ridiculously conspiratorial."
"Freud had me knock on Jung's door, to no avail. They waited until <-<-<-<eight>->->->, then set off for Brill's without him."
"It's the twenty-third of June nineteen seventy-five, and it is <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->-> in the evening, seated at his jigsaw puzzle, Bartlebooth has just died."
She looked at her watch- it was <-<-<-<eight o'clock>->->->
"That day he forgot to go to dinner; he noticed the fact at <-<-<-<eight in the evening>->->->, and as it was too late to go to the Rue St. Jaques, he ate a lump of bread."
"The clock struck <-<-<-<eight>->->->. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house; and so strong was the persuasion that she did, in spite of the almost impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window-shutter, to be satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her."
"Upon one of the largest and most beautiful of the steamers which ever glided down the shining pathway of the river upon a moonlight night of summer, I stepped, at <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> in the evening, accompanied by several of my friends, and carrying in my pocket a box of boluses. The gangplank was drawn in, and we were on our way."
But to return from my digression. It was perhaps <-<-<-<eight o’clock>->->-> in the evening when I took the dose of fifty grains.
"The Lenox Station was easily reached on time. The hands of the big clock were only at <-<-<-<one minute past eight>->->-> when Cyrus entered. At the designated spot the messenger met him. Cyrus recognized the man as a porter on one of the trains of the road of which his grandfather and father were officers. Why, yes, he was the porter of the Woodbridge special car!"
"It was only <-<-<-<a little after eight o'clock>->->->, so all the shows were about silliness or murder."
"Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he's not there, then go there and catch him. Anna looked at the railway timetable in the newspapers. An evening train went at <-<-<-<two minutes past eight>->->->. ""Yes, I shall be in time."""
"Yes, well. Obviously she's dead and it's very recent. Within the last two hours, if you press me. But you must have come to that conclusion yourselves or you wouldn't have cut her down. When did you say you found her? <-<-<-<Three minutes after eight>->->->."
"He taught me that if I had to meet someone for an appointment, I must refuse to follow the ""stupid human habit"" of arbitrarily choosing a time based on fifteen-minute intervals. ""Never meet people at 7:45 or 6:30, Jasper, but pick times like 7:12 and <-<-<-<8:03>->->->!"""
"I might talk to the GP about getting some sleeping pills. I noticed that my watch had stopped at <-<-<-<three minutes past eight>->->->, and I wondered if that was the exact time our baby died."
Doublepark and hope no traffic cop’s around. Stroll nonchalantly towards house—bet she’s still in the tub. Check watch: <-<-<-<8:04>->->->. Perfect. Ring doorbell.
The earth seems to cast its darkness upward into the air. The farm country is somber at night. He is grateful when the lights of Lankaster merge with his dim beams. He stops at a diner who's clock says <-<-<-<8.04>->->->.
"She asked her last question: ""When you left by the Devereux Court gate at about <-<-<-<five minutes past eight>->->->, did you see anyone in Pawlet Court or entering Middle Temple?""<br>Catherine said: ""No one. Devereux Court and the passage out to the Strand were deserted."""
"December 23rd At <-<-<-<8.05 pm>->->-> Prof. Preobrazhensky commenced the first operation of its kind to be performed in Europe: removal under anaesthesia of a dog's testicles and their replacement by implanted human testes, with appendages and seminal ducts, taken from a 28-year-old human male"
"Ransom took out his watch, which he had adapted, on purpose, several hours before, to Boston time, and saw that the minutes had sped with increasing velocity during this interview, and that it now marked <-<-<-<five minutes past eight>->->->."
"Well, it’s <-<-<-<five-past eight>->->-> now, I said to Drake. ""You’d better go straight off and organise a flashing party. There’s not a hope of a sortie tonight at sea, but we’d better be on the safe side."""
"Met by another Secret Service man also in dinner jacket. Also better tie. I give up. Escorted to elevator. Check watch: <-<-<-<8:06>->->->. Not bad. Enter West Sitting Hall.<br>“Good evening, Madam President.”"
It was <-<-<-<six minutes past eight>->->-> when I arrived at the lighthouse. I was unable to gain entry. The door was locked.
"And I could hear that there were fewer people in the little station when the train wasn't there, so I opened my eyes and I looked at my watch and it said <-<-<-<8:07 p.m.>->->-> and I had been sitting on the bench for approximately 5 hours but it hadn't seemed like approximately 5 hours, except that my bottom hurt and I was hungry and thirsty."
"Bennie pulled the transcripts for that night. The first call had come in at <-<-<-<8:07>->->->, with a positive ID."
"Monday <-<-<-<8:08 P.M.>->->-><br>He glanced at his watch, then looked out his smudgy hotel window and down at the Strand. Two more minutes and there should be a knock on the door."
"I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until <-<-<-<after eight o’clock>->->-> the apartment was full of cheerful sun."
"It is <-<-<-<ten minutes past eight>->->->. I must tell you how much I love you at ten minutes past eight on a Sunday evening, January 27th 1918."
"<-<-<-<8:10 P.M.>->->-><br>Even on a regular night, The Truth was intolerable. The floor was coated in sawdust, music that could only be described as cock-metal blasted on the sound system, Christmas lights flashed out of sync at a headache-inducing pace, and the walls were covered with faux-homey wooden signs that said shit like:<br>YOU ARE NEVER<br>2 OLD<br>2 DRINK<br>2 MANY<br>6 PACKS"
"At <-<-<-<2010h.>->->-> on 1 April Y.D.A.U., the medical attache is still watching the unlabelled entertainment cartridge."
"The Hurleys arrived at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past eight>->->-> precisely. When I opened the front door, Martin pushed Paige, nearly seven months pregnant and large, into the hall.<br>""Thought you could do with some early back-up,"" he murmured, as Nathan unwrapped Paige from her coat."
"At <-<-<-<twelve minutes past eight o'clock>->->->, the embassy's security gate slid open, and a black Mercedes sedan nosed into view. It turned left and passed within a few inches of the camera - so close, in fact, that Gabriel felt as though he could reach out and pluck the single passenger from the backseat."
"<-<-<-<8:13 P.M.>->->-><br>What a day! When Ally finally settled onto her couch, after giving Knickers a long walk, she was exhausted. She leaned back and kicked off her shoes. There had been a few moments of tightness in her chest—maybe it was psychological, anxiety‑induced—but that was gone now."
"When a call came through to Dilworth’s home number at <-<-<-<fourteen minutes past eight>->->-> o’clock, Olbier and Jones reacted with far more excitement than the situation warranted because they were desperate for action."
By <-<-<-<8.15>->->-> on Sunday night Theresa had finished the last of her long-deferred homework and thought she could safely put away her arithmetic book and tell her father she was tired and ready for bed.
<-<-<-<8:15 p.m.>->->-> Humph. Cannot locate operating instructions.
<-<-<-<8.15 p.m.>->->-> Get changed into pyjamas
"He kissed her hand and after a while went to get two more drinks. When he got back, it was <-<-<-<sixteen minutes past eight>->->->, and Lois was humming softly along with the jukebox"
"<-<-<-<20.17>->->-> A red warning light failed to go on in the Drive Room, beginning a chain of events which would lead, in a further twenty-three minutes, to the total annihilation of the entire crew of Red Dwarf."
<-<-<-<2018 hrs>->->-> Katya has arrived at the Odessa Hotel. Barley and Katya are talking in the canteen. Wicklow and one irregular observing. More.
At <-<-<-<8:19>->->-> she received a second phone call to let her know the plane had taken off from Amman with the “cargo” on board.
All was still. It was <-<-<-<nineteen minutes past eight>->->->.
"At each end of the forecourt the two great globes of light supported by bronze dolphins threw shining pools on the heaving surface of the water which as she watched shimmered like a great cloak of black satin, shaken, smoothed and gently billowed by an invisible hand. Mandy glanced at her watch: <-<-<-<8:20>->->->."
"Again the boy knocked. Again there was no response. Gabriel watched and suffered with him until, at <-<-<-<twenty past eight>->->->, the boy finally gave up and turned away."
<-<-<-<Eight-twenty>->->-> the cards and puzzles go out. . . .
<-<-<-<8.20 p.m.>->->-> Play computer games
"At <-<-<-<20.20>->->-> all ships had completed oiling. Hove to, they had had the utmost difficulty in keeping position in that great wind; but they were infinitely safer than in the open sea"
"Knowing that the dinner was only for us six, we never dreamed it would be a full dress affair. I had no appetite. It was quite <-<-<-<twenty minutes past eight>->->-> before we sat down to dinner."
"It was <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes past eight>->->->. The town clerk’s office would be open until nine o’clock. The day was Saturday and taxpayers came in to settle their assessments and water rents. There was time, then, that night, to get a marriage license."
"At <-<-<-<8.21>->->->, after a knock at the door, a constable said a military police vehicle had just driven into the courtyard, the driver asking for ""Mr."" Murray."
"<-<-<-<8:22 P.M.>->->-><br>Eric Hamblin, formerly of Sweetwater, Texas, had worked as a guard for SatCom for the past two and a half years and he loved the job. He was twenty-four, a college-dropout casualty of the go-go eighties who got to spend his afternoons hanging out on one of Greece's most beautiful islands."
"<-<-<-<20.23>->->->. In a few minutes she would go down. She could have borrowed some mascara from her daughter Sally, but it was too late. She could have rung her mother in Northam, but it was too late. Seven minutes of solitude she had, and then she would descend."
Peach checked his watch. <-<-<-<8.24.>->->-> If he wasn't in a taxi in twenty minutes he'd be done for.
"He already felt drunk enough at the thought of being with Sunny. He glanced at his watch. <-<-<-<Eight-twenty-five>->->->. He loosened his tie,  dark yellow with a muted pattern and unbuttoned the top button of his blue shirt."
<-<-<-<Eight-twenty-five>->->-> some Acute mentions he used to watch his sister taking her bath; the three guys at the table with him fall over each other to see who gets to write it in the log book. . . .
She sat down in her usual seat and smiled at her husband as he sank into his own chair opposite her. She was saved. It was only <-<-<-<five and twenty past eight>->->->.
"It was <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes past eight>->->->. Without hesitation he went to the cloakroom, and, producing a ticker, was handed a large valise, a rug, and a thick long ulster of dark tweed."
"<-<-<-<8:26 P.M.>->->-><br>""Pad perimeter secure,"" Jamal Khan, Salim's intense younger brother said in Farsi, his voice matter-of-fact. He'd just wasted some stranger; no big deal."
"At <-<-<-<seven-and-twenty minutes past eight>->->-> Mrs. Lofthouse was seated at Aurora's piano, in the first agonies of a prelude in six flats; a prelude which demanded such extraordinary uses of the left hand across the right, and the right over the left, and such exercise of the thumbs in all positions"
"Her sister was as loyal as the day was long. There was no way she would have left the spot where they were supposed to meet, not with the sirens screaming. And so it was that she had been stuck there when another unearthly sound had ripped over the crowd’s heads at <-<-<-<8.27 p.m.>->->->"
"Still seated, Haver looked up at the clock and said out of the blue: ""My father died exactly twenty-five years ago.""<br>Lindell looked up. ""Exactly?""<br>""Yes, exactly. <-<-<-<Twenty-eight minutes past eight>->->->, on this exact date twenty-five years ago."""
"<-<-<-<Twenty-nine and a half minutes past eight>->->->, sir. And then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made further oration. ""By George! that clock's half an hour fast! First time in ten years I've known it to be off. This watch of mine never varies a--"" But the citizen was talking to vacancy. He turned and saw his hearer, a fast receding black shadow, flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows."
"At <-<-<-<8.29>->->-> I punched the front doorbell in Elgin Crescent. It was opened by a small oriental woman in a white apron. She showed me into a large, empty sitting room with an open fire and a couple of huge oil paintings."
"The dogs gave up and started to wander by <-<-<-<8:30 P.M.>->->-> John was numb by then. It was twenty degrees, and he was unsure how much longer he could stay on top of the truck exposed to the wind and cold."
"In the evening, I roll over alone to an empty bottle of malbec by the bed. A sleek table clock says it’s <-<-<-<half past eight>->->->. I throw on a tee and cotton shorts and follow the smell of dinner down a winding staircase."
"By <-<-<-<eight-thirty>->->->, with dusk growing too thick to be much different from night, the five searchers had grown to a dozen."
"At <-<-<-<half past eight>->->-> Millicent Hammitt barged in, without a preliminary knock, to say goodbye."
"Outside, the wind continued to rise. Every now and then it gave a blood-curdling scream around the eaves that made him look up from his book. Around <-<-<-<eight thirty>->->->, the snow began. It was heavy and wet, quickly coating his window and blocking his view of the mountains. In a way, that was worse. The snow had blocked the windows in the Overlook, too."
"At <-<-<-<eight thirty>->->->, I called and said, “I’ve been thinking I might get a boob job, just take them clean off. What do you think? Could I pull off the flat-chested look?”"
"<-<-<-<Eight-thirty>->->-> the ward door opens and two technicians trot in, smelling like grape wine; technicians always move at a fast walk or a trot because they’re always leaning so far forward they have to move fast to keep standing."
"“What nonsense!” thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch.<br>It was <-<-<-<half-past eight>->->-> already."
"Alix took up a piece of needlework and began to stitch. Gerald read a few pages of his book. Then he glanced up at the clock and tossed the book away. ""<-<-<-<Half-past eight>->->->. Time to go down to the cellar and start work."""
"The bicycles go by in twos and threes - there's a dance on in Billy Brennan's barn tonight, and there's the half-talk code of mysteries and the wink-and-elbow language of delight. <-<-<-<Half-past eight>->->-> and there is not a spot upon a mile of road, no shadow thrown that might turn out a man or woman,"
"The time display read <-<-<-<20:31>->->-> on the same evening. Almost dusk. The scene was motionless save the soft rustling of leaves, but the rumble of a car engine and the crunch of tires on gravel must have triggered the recording."
"At the station he captured Miss Lantry out of the gadding mob at <-<-<-<eight thirty-two>->->->. ""We mustn't keep mamma and the others waiting,"" said she. ""To Wallack's Theatre as fast as you can drive!"""
"<-<-<-<20.33>->->-> Navigation officer Henri DuBois knocked his black cona coffee with four sugars over his computer console keyboard. As he mopped up the coffee, he noticed three red warning blips on his monitor screen, which he wrongly assumed were the result of his spillage."
"He wrote: ""Cough (hacking): <-<-<-<20:34>->->-> (Duration: 24 seconds)"""
<-<-<-<8:35 p.m.>->->-> Hah! Found operating instructions under Hello! Right.
"Left Munich at <-<-<-<8.35 p.m.>->->-> on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early the next morning"
"She paused reflectively. He was keenly interested now, not a doubt of it. The murderer is bound to have an interest in murder. She had gambled on that, and succeeded. She stole a glance at the clock. It was <-<-<-<five and twenty to nine>->->->."
<-<-<-<20.36>->->-> Rimmer stood in the main wash-room on the stasis deck and combed his hair.
"Pierce got to his feet and took his watch from his waistcoat, an incongruously clean gold object at the end of a soot-black chain. He snapped it open: it was <-<-<-<8:37>->->->."
"<-<-<-<8:37 P.M.>->->-><br>Braque sat in a Pepto-Bismol pink toilet stall in the otherwise empty women’s bathroom and opened the jar of green sweet pepper jelly. Even with the sound of AC/DC playing and the smell of cheap bleach rising to her face, the scent of the jelly overwhelmed her senses."
"And at <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes to nine>->->->, at the beginning of the third act, he stood up and, trying not to make too much noise, left the auditorium and walked up to the second floor."
"<-<-<-<8:39 P.M.>->->-><br>Cally was thinking about how much she would love a pizza, heavy on the cheese and Italian sausage. No, just heavy on the cholesterol. Why was it that the only things that tasted good were all supposed to be bad for you?"
"Actually, I was early. I didn't want to make myself conspicuous loitering in the passage, so I killed five minutes walking along the Strand. I was outside the gate at ten past eight. I waited until <-<-<-<eight-forty>->->->. Venetia never came."
"On the seventeenth. That was so. They were seated at <-<-<-<twenty minutes to nine>->->->. It's a little foible of mine, to note the time the customer is actually seated."
"Are you on your own, miss?<br>It was a stupid question and it annoyed her. There were a lot of cross answers she could have snapped out, but she swallowed them and just said, ""Yes.""<br>""Waiting for the <-<-<-<8.40>->->->, are you?""<br>""Is there any other?""<br>""Well, no. Not this time of night."""
"It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped at <-<-<-<twenty minutes to nine>->->->, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine."
The letter had been brought in at <-<-<-<twenty minutes to nine>->->->.
"It’s <-<-<-<08:41>->->-> and I’m in Bed practicing. Ma’s filled a plastic bag with really hot water and tied it tight so none spills out, she puts it in another bag and ties that too."
"“Yeah, I was just thinking . . .”<br>Shan stole a glance at the pendulum wall clock. <-<-<-<Eight forty-two>->->->. Eighteen minutes before he’d be escorted back. “I’m worried I left the drip hose on. If Ranger Roy gets here early, tell him I’ll be back in a few.”"
"The hand at this moment pointed to <-<-<-<8.42>->->->. The players took up their cards, but their eyes were constantly on the clock. One may safely say that, however secure they might feel, never had minutes seemed so long to them."
"Either way, he mustn’t be allowed to return to the White House.” The line went dead. Cavalli knew that his father was right on both counts. Cavalli checked his watch again: <-<-<-<8:43>->->->."
"I’ll tell you exactly what I want you to say when he phones back, but never forget that your first priority is to buy me as much time as possible. The SBS can’t make a move until after sunset, <-<-<-<20.43>->->-> local time, which isn’t’ – he checked his watch – ‘for another two hours and nineteen minutes.’"
"'<-<-<-<8.43>->->->,' said Thomas Flanagan, as he cut the cards placed before him by Gauthier Ralph. There was a moment's pause, during which the spacious room was perfectly silent."
"The clock's pendulum beat every second with mathematical regularity, and each player could count every sixtieth of a minute as it struck his ear. ""<-<-<-<8.44!>->->->"" said John Sullivan, in a voice that betrayed his emotion. Only one minute more and the wager would be won."
"When it got to be <-<-<-<a quarter to nine>->->-> and still no one had shown up, Gardener began to wonder if maybe they were quitting. He toyed with the idea as he sat in Bobbi’s rocker on the porch, fingering the big, puffy bruise on the side of his face where Bozeman had clouted him."
"At <-<-<-<eight forty-five>->->->, I called and said, “I need some financial advice. Actually, I’m serious. I’m in a bind.”"
"It's not impossible, Phileas said quietly. ""I bet you 20,000 pounds I could do it. If I leave this evening on the <-<-<-<8.45>->->-> train to Dover, I can be back here at the Reform Club by 8.45 on Saturday 21 December. I'll get my passport stamped at every place I stop to prove I've been around the world."""
Beaver arrived at <-<-<-<quarter to nine>->->-> in a state of high self-approval; he had refused two invitations for dinner while dressing that evening; he had cashed a cheque for ten pounds at his club; he had booked a Divan table at Espinosa's.
And then he walked into the bedroom and saw the one clue that confirmed that Tina had been in the apartment on the evening of 9/11. By the side of Anna’s bed was a watch. Jack checked the time: <-<-<-<8:46>->->->.
"At the tone, the time will be <-<-<-<eight forty six>->->->, exactly. One cubic mile of seawater contains about 50 pounds of gold."
"It read <-<-<-<20:47>->->-> on the cooker clock when Fliss heard the jangle of Ben's keys in the door. Somewhere along the line, her husband had stopped making any effort."
"It only wants <-<-<-<twelve minutes to nine>->->->, Constance pointed out. ""Well, what if it does?"""
"At <-<-<-<8:49>->->-> there was a loud rap on the door, and Sir Hamish muttered an inaudible reproach as David Heath went to open it. He found his contact standing there."
"<-<-<-<8.49>->->->. I took the phone, cleared my throat, and dialed the keep, the packs stronghold on the outskirts of Atlanta. Just keep it professional. Less pathetic that way."
"He rang up his servant, dressed in haste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late. As he drove up to the Karenins’ entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was <-<-<-<ten minutes to nine>->->->."
"<-<-<-<8:50 p.m.>->->-> Ah. Diagram. ""Buttons for IMC functions."" But what are IMC functions?"
All the clocks in London were striking <-<-<-<ten minutes before nine>->->->.
"He glanced at the bracket-clock on the mantelpiece, but as this had stopped, drew out his watch. ""It is already too late,"" he said. ""It wants only <-<-<-<ten minutes to nine>->->->.""<br>""Good God!"" she exclaimed, turning quite pale. ""What am I to do?"""
"He was, yes, always home from work by <-<-<-<2050>->->-> on Thursdays."
"What did it mean by beginning to tick so loudly all of a sudden? Its face indicated <-<-<-<ten minutes to nine>->->->. Mrs Verloc cared nothing for time, and the ticking went on."
"I stayed watching the polestar from <-<-<-<nine minutes to nine>->->-> until ten past, tilting my head back till it hurt, fighting off dizziness and not taking my eyes off the distant, twinkling light which is our rendezvous in the sky, trying to see your face looking back at me."
"“That’d be the <-<-<-<8:52>->->->, change at Doncaster and Peterborough. You should be back in Cambridge just after midnight.”"
"The waitress brought my coffee. I carried it to the far end of the counter and drank it slowly. It was <-<-<-<eight minutes to nine>->->->. People were lining up at the loading door, which meant that a bus was expected."
Only <-<-<-<eight fifty-three>->->->. The partners' decision meeting starts in seven minutes. I'm not sure I can bear this.
"I tried to restart our dinner-table conversation, which had been about the validity of I.Q. tests, but he was back in his funk again, and I didn't feel like trying to jolly him out of it. I was relieved when the bell squawked at <-<-<-<six minutes to nine>->->->; now maybe we'd get some action."
"Sitting on his bed in the spotless, white-walled room of the disease isolation unit, Merral D’Avanos looked up at the wall clock. It was <-<-<-<five to nine>->->->."
"Linus began to walk down the hallway slowly.  Rain lashed against the windows to his left.  The lights in the sconces to his right flicked slightly.  His loafers squeaked on the floor.  He pulled at his tie.  By the time he reached the opposite end of the hallway, four minutes had passed.  According to his watch, it was <-<-<-<five till nine>->->->."
"And the past. The clock on the dash said <-<-<-<8:55 pm>->->->. And the last pink shard of the sun was reaching up into the night sky, desperately trying to hold on for just one more minute."
"“No. 7 berth—a second-class. The gentleman has not yet come, and it is <-<-<-<four minutes to nine>->->->."""
"She points up at Watch that says 08:57, that’s <-<-<-<only three minutes before nine>->->->. So I run into Wardrobe and lie down on my pillow and wrap up in Blanket that’s all grey and fleecy with the red piping."
"Wait, he said solemnly, ""till the clock strikes. I have wealth and power and knowledge above most men, but when the clock strikes I am afraid. Stay by me until then. This woman shall be yours. You have the word of the hereditary Prince of Valleluna. On the day of your marriage I will give you $100,000 and a palace on the Hudson. But there must be no clocks in that palace--they measure our follies and limit our pleasures. Do you agree to that?""<br>""Of course,"" said the young man, cheerfully, ""they're a nuisance, anyway--always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner."" He glanced again at the clock in the tower. The hands stood at <-<-<-<three minutes to nine>->->->."
"What time is it? she asked, quiet, definite, hopeless.<br>""<-<-<-<Two minutes to nine>->->->,"" he replied, telling the truth with a struggle."
"However, you will go no farther than two miles from the barracks, you will behave in a manner that befits a Royal Fusilier and you will report back to the guardroom sober as a judge at <-<-<-<one minute before nine>->->->."
"Normally an assistant would have put [the television] on for him at <-<-<-<one minute to nine>->->->. He sat watching a Nigerian woman give a talk on dressmaking, followed by the weather forecast man who supplied Eduardo with the revealing information that the temperature would continue to be hot for the next month."
"Well, what an amazing culinary experience, Eva said at <-<-<-<8:59 p.m.>->->->, when Prager’s car parked in front of her apartment."
"They who had to go to bed so punctually, for whom the lights went out at <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->->, could stay at Obermeier Farm until the fireflies and the stars came out-until the Chinese lanterns were lit and they could walk once more about the farm with their jovial host and hostess with these beautiful, swaying, colored lights."
"The storm held off until <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->, and by then Anderson was pretty sure they were going to have a good one - what Havenites called “a real Jeezer.”"
The clock struck <-<-<-<nine>->->-> when I did send the Nurse.<br>In half an hour she promised to return.
"It was almost <-<-<-<9:00 P.M.>->->-> The full moon was blurred by drifting mist, and their blunted shadows led them across an open field, toward dark woods beyond."
"By <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> Saturday night Lakeside Avenue, the main street, was thronged with some four thousand beer-drinking tourists, about half riding motorcycles."
"It was <-<-<-<nine o’clock in the evening>->->->, in Blackbury High Street.<br>In the window of the electrical shop, nine TVs showed the same picture. Nine televisions projected their flickering screens at the empty air."
"He turned away from the window, his arms rashed out in gooseflesh. He’d gotten a sandwich from the Red Apple store and had planned to eat it while he started the John Sandford paperback he’d also picked up at the Red Apple, but after a few bites he rewrapped the sandwich and put it on the windowsill, where it would stay cold. He might eat the rest later, although he didn’t think he’d be staying up much past <-<-<-<nine>->->-> tonight; if he got a hundred pages into the book, he’d be doing well."
"Anyhow, this all took place on a windy night in the beginning of October. It was actually kind of steamy for the time of year. A swarm of mosquitos buzzed around in the evening, and I remember burning a couple of mosquito-repellent coils to keep them away. The wind was noisy. The gate to the swimming pool was broken and the wind made the gate slap open and shut. I thought of fixing it, but it was too dark out, so it kept banging all night.<br>My <-<-<-<nine p.m.>->->-> round went by fine, all twenty items on my list nearly checked off."
"He keeps smiling all the time, smiling like a rosy little bedbug that has had its fill. “It was <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->,” he says once again, “when I called you up, wasn’t it?” I nod my head wearily. Yes, it was nine o’clock. He is certain now that it was nine o’clock because he remembers having taken out his watch."
"At <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->, I called again. He answered.<br>“What do you want?” he asked.<br>“I was hoping to hear you say you miss me.”<br>“I miss you,” he said. “Is that it?”<br>I hung up."
"Someone left a collection of books out on the curb one day on East Seventy-seventh Street, and I brought them home and read them all cover to cover. A history of drunk driving in America. An Indian cookbook. 𝘞𝘢𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘦. 𝘔𝘢𝘰 𝘐𝘐. 𝘐𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘢𝘯 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘋𝘶𝘮𝘮𝘪𝘦𝘴. A book of Mad Libs that I filled in myself using the simplest words I could think of. I passed the days like this for four or five weeks. I did not buy a cell phone. I got rid of the old mattress. Every night at <-<-<-<nine>->->-> I lay down on the smooth hardwood floor with a stretch and a yawn, and I had no trouble sleeping."
"About <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House."
"She stared back, surprised and confused. Then defiant. Abruptly she closed the laptop, stuffed it in her bag. She withdrew a pen and scribbled an address on a napkin. “If you change your mind,” she said stiffly, standing, “I will be at this location between eight o’clock and <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> tonight.”"
"However, at <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap, went out for his usual walk."
"At <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->->, Emily Brent rose to her feet.<br>She said:<br>“I’m going to bed.”"
<-<-<-<9.00 p.m.>->->-> Watch television or a video
At <-<-<-<2100>->->-> at night it's cold out.
"I got home from working at Burger Boy tonight about <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->->, and I was kind of surprised because the whole house was dark."
"It was <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> at night upon the second of August—the most terrible August in the history of the world. One might have thought already that God's curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the sultry and stagnant air"
"On the evening before K.'s thirty-first birthday - it was about <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->->, when there is a lull in the streets - two gentlemen came to his apartment."
"On the stroke of <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> Mr. and Mrs. De Voted took their places on either side of the drawing-room fire, in attitudes of gracefully combined hospitality and unconcern, Vivian De Voted wearing a black beard and black velvet jacket buttoned over his Bohemian bosom, his lady in a flowing purple gown embroidered in divers appropriate places with pomegranates and their leaves."
"Shortly after <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans to Kutuzov's quarters where the council of war was to be held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief's and with the exception of Prince Bagration, who declined to come, were all there at the appointed time."
"Standing in the chrome-and-tile desolation of the Polar-Shtern Kafeteria at <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> on a Friday night, in a snowstorm, he's the loneliest Jew in the Sitka District."
That night <-<-<-<at nine>->->-> the President addressed the nation.
"Then he put on a grey jacket and left the flat to make his way to Praca da Alegria. It was already <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->->, Pereira maintains."
"This time, the putting on of her best hat at <-<-<-<nine o'clock>->->-> at night with the idea of sallying forth from the castle, down the long drive and then northwards along the acacia avenue, had been enough to send her to her own doorway as though she suspected someone might be there, someone who was listening to her thoughts."
"At <-<-<-<nine o’clock>->->-> in the evening I was sitting among my friends writing, while they talked around me. I became aware that it was gradually growing easier for me to express myself; my pen glanced presently like lightning in the effort to keep neck and neck with my ideas."
"He figured he’d start her out with an exceptionally American meal: cheeseburgers, fries, potato salad, Coke. He’d get a pie for dessert: apple. He’d top it off with ice cream and watch as she squirmed and squealed. When she finished, he’d lift her from her chair, carry her to the bedroom, kiss every inch. They’d have sex all night, and this time, he wouldn’t pay.<br>He looked at his watch—<-<-<-<9:01 P.M.>->->->"
"It was <-<-<-<past nine>->->->. William had finished his homework and his supper. Once he had said good night to his parents and Mrs. Phillips, he crept upstairs to the attic with the two bugs, his flashlight, and his magnifying glass. He wanted to take a closer look at the token."
"On the evening before K.'s thirty-first birthday - it was <-<-<-<about nine o'clock>->->->, when there is a lull in the streets - two gentlemen came to his apartment."
"The good Brants did not allow the boys to play out <-<-<-<after nine>->->-> in summer evenings; they were sent to bed at that hour; Eddie honorably remained, but Georgie usually slipped out of the window toward ten, and enjoyed himself until midnight."
"Billy Weaver had travelled down from London on the slow afternoon train, with a change at Swindon on the way, and by the time he got to Bath it was <-<-<-<about nine o’clock>->->-> in the evening and the moon was coming up out of a clear starry sky over the houses opposite the station entrance. But the air was deadly cold and the wind was like a flat blade of ice on his cheeks."
I hurried across the square. Checked my watch. It was <-<-<-<two minutes past nine>->->->. He kept me waiting the last time.
"Sebastian remained seated, staring at the phone, willing it to ring. At <-<-<-<three minutes past nine>->->->, someone obeyed his command."

"In the light of a narrow-beam lantern, Pierce checked his watch. It was <-<-<-<9:04>->->->. That gave them an hour to find the key before Barlow provided his diversion to cover their escape."
"<-<-<-<9:04 P.M.>->->-><br>""How does an ETA of 0200 hours sound to you?"" Dimitri Spiros was using an unsecured radio, but he had no choice. ""That'll give us about twenty-nine hours. Enough time to get everything together."""
"At <-<-<-<9.04 pm>->->-> trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Burgess Shale."
"<-<-<-<Nine-five>->->->. A voice spoke from the study ceiling: ""Mrs. McClellan, which poem would you like this evening?"". The house was silent. The voice said at last, ""Since you express no preference, I shall select a poem at random."""
"The Parisienne? She coming here!<br>""Yes, with her father, by the train which gets in at <-<-<-<six minutes past nine>->->-> to-morrow."""
"He just rolled up his window, switched off the engine, and leaned down to unlock the trunk. I checked my watch. It was <-<-<-<seven minutes past nine>->->->."
"At exactly <-<-<-<eight minutes past nine>->->->, the fault, already weakened by the preliminary tremor, now without warning shifted violently and slipped a hundred or so feet, sucking down with it some billions of tons of water."
"<-<-<-<9.09>->->->. Too late to turn around and go back. Too late, too dangerous."
"Harry realized that if he was going to be back at the airport in time to board the <-<-<-<21:10>->->-> to Heathrow, he would only have twenty or thirty minutes to spare. But that should be more than enough."
"She liked to swim most nights just after the nine o'clock news; everyone knew that - at least, everyone who knew her. And the news on Sunday was at <-<-<-<9.10>->->->."
"Ivor, where were you on Tuesday night? You've never been late for a cell meeting before, you've always been there before the rest of us. But it was <-<-<-<ten past nine>->->-> when you arrived."
"<-<-<-<9:10 p.m.>->->-> ""When you turn your recorder on you must adjust clock and the calendar for precise TIMER-controlled recording (don't forget to use the quick-adjust options to switch between summer and winter time). Clock menus called with red and digital number 6."""
These new locks yielded easily to Agar's attentions. At <-<-<-<9:11>->->-> they swung the grating door open and entered the wine cellar proper. They immediately began the search for the key.
"Every few seconds the house changed character, at one time menacing and sinister, and again the innocent abode of law-abiding citizens about to be attacked by my private army. The luminous watch said <-<-<-<9.11>->->->."
"There was a big full moon that night, the sky clear as glass, and at <-<-<-<9:12 p.m.>->->-> an old Russian rocket reentered the earth’s atmosphere and exploded into flaring comets with long, burning tails that streaked across the sky."
"The crime was reported to us (with almost indecent alacrity, Rog) at <-<-<-<21.12>->->->, by Susan Trott - of Black Grouse Cottage - who had been, I quote: ""out looking for hedgehogs when I was horrified to notice the postbox door had fallen off and was just lying there, on the ground."""
"Now Oberhammer's mansion mouldered: windows boarded, its walls wrapped in chains to keep them from bursting under the weight of the folly above. The clock tower forever displayed <-<-<-<thirteen minutes past nine>->->->, the time for rats and bats and lunatics, for every ghoul and demon conceived by Deepgate's commoners."
He was dimly conscious that he was trying to get the ring on Milly’s finger; it didn’t fit half so well as it had in the jewelry store. Ezra was grinning—showing ivories like an enameled picket-fence—it was <-<-<-<fourteen minutes after nine o’clock>->->->—Carol had said she wanted the living room furnished in Mission
"Not too late to go back down to the Red Apple. Grab a bottle of something. Put all these unpleasant thoughts to bed.<br>No. He was going to read his book. Lucas Davenport was on the case, and he was going to read his book.<br>He closed it at <-<-<-<quarter past nine>->->-> and got into another rooming-house bed. I won’t sleep, he thought. Not with the wind screaming like that.<br>But he did."
"It was a <-<-<-<quarter-past nine>->->-> when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street."
<-<-<-<9.15>->->->. Did Roberts pay you yet?
What are we going to do? Should we try to walk to Clapham High Street? But it's bloody miles away. I glance at my watch and am shocked to see that it's <-<-<-<nine-fifteen>->->->. We've spent over an hour faffing about and we haven't even had a drink. And it's all my fault. I can't even organize one simple evening without its going catastrophically wrong.
"Leonard checked his watch—<-<-<-<9:16 P.M.>->->-> He went to his computer, logged onto his AOL account. Though he’d been instructed not to email, he wrote a message to John. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘨𝘰𝘯𝘯𝘢 𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘦? He logged out."
"<-<-<-<21:17>->->->, Sunday Evening, Angbyplan. A man is observed outside the hair salon. He presses his face and hands against the glass, and appears extremely intoxicated."
"The same thing would hold true if there were someone in her apartment. In that case he would just say that he had been passing by, recognized her charming house, and thought to drop in. It was <-<-<-<eighteen minutes after nine>->->-> when Mr. Martin turned into Twelfth Street."
The first movement of Mendelssohn's accursed violin concerto was about twelve and a half minutes long. The Jew had started playing it at <-<-<-<nineteen minutes past nine>->->->.
"At <-<-<-<9.20>->->-> he switched off the set and, for a few minutes, sat immobile with the tray still on his lap. He thought that he must look like one of those modern paintings, Man with a Tray, a stiff figure immobilized in an ordinary setting made unordinary, even sinister."
"Grant knew animals often performed such mating rituals for hours at a time. They went without food, they paid attention to nothing else. . . .  He glanced at his watch. <-<-<-<Nine-twenty>->->->."
The whole party had dined well. They were satisfied with themselves and with life. The hands of the clock pointed to <-<-<-<twenty minutes past nine>->->->. There was a silence - a comfortable replete silence.
<-<-<-<9.20 p.m.>->->-> Have juice and a snack
"At <-<-<-<twenty minutes past nine>->->->, the Duke of Dunstable, who had dined off a tray in his room, was still there, waiting for his coffee and liqueur."
"These witnesses could recall with startling accuracy every detail that had occurred between seventeen minutes after eight and <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes past nine>->->-> on the night of September 23 over a year before; but where they had been and what they had done ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later, or where they were at nine o'clock in the evening last Friday they couldn't for the lives of them remember."
"Fifteen minutes later (<-<-<-<21.22 hrs>->->->), Miss Squire arrives in Skipton where she is booked into a local B&B. This B&B is located directly across the road from Mhairi Callaghan's Feathercuts."

"When do you call time of death on a marriage?<br>A hard question for others perhaps, but lucky me, mine’s been timestamped.<br><-<-<-<9:24 p.m.>->->->"
"The phone on his desk rang, startling him. It was <-<-<-<nine twenty-five>->->->. He hadn't realized he had been sitting as if in a fugue."
"<-<-<-<9:25 p.m.>->->-> Aargh. Suddenly main menu is on TV saying ""Press 6."" Oh dear. Realize was using telly remote control by mistake. Now news has come on."
"This is the table on which Tom Tear will work if ever he becomes an architect. At that moment the table was horizontal and there was a clock on it, and an electric lamp which didn’t work, and a burning candle, and a radio with a plastic cabinet in which another clock was inlaid. Both clocks said <-<-<-<twenty-five past nine>->->->."
"It was <-<-<-<twenty-six minutes past nine>->->->. As he had expected, and as had happened every night since Curry had installed the private wire in his Madison Avenue residence, the operator on the up-town end of the line switched off."
"The terrorists, he began, ""crossed the border at <-<-<-<21.26>->->-> last night. Four passports were presented to the immigration officer for stamping. Three were of Swedish origin, and one was from Iraq."""
"“It must be some time since you’ve been shopping in Paris,” she had told him. “That’s just about enough for a pair of jeans and a couple of T-shirts.” Kratz had reluctantly handed over another five thousand francs.<br>At <-<-<-<9:27>->->-> the phone rang."
"The call came at <-<-<-<nine-twenty-seven P.M.>->->->, after dark had swept over most of the sky. There was still a narrow strip of washed-out blue along the western horizon, more like the memory of light, but it would soon be gone."
"From that moment on--<-<-<-<9:28>->->-> in the evening, June 18, 1941--everything was different."
"The call had been made at <-<-<-<9:28>->->->. This was one more piece of evidence, and an important one. It proved what they had suspected from the first: that the killer was in St. Anselm's."
"It was <-<-<-<9:29>->->-> and Raphael, entering the sacristy last, found only Father Sebastian taking off his cloak before robing for the service."
"We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice until <-<-<-<half-past nine>->->->, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house."
"Grant opened his eyes. Brilliant blue light was streaming into the building through the bars of the gate. Quartz light: the power was back on! Groggily, he looked at his watch. It was just <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->->. He’d been asleep only a couple of minutes."
"The men come at <-<-<-<nine thirty in the evening>->->->. Roxy was supposed to have gone over to her cousins that night; it had been arranged for weeks, but she’d given her mum lip about not getting her the right tights from Primark, so her Mum said, ""You’re not going, you’re staying in."""
"Then just before <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->-> he started letting them win, lets them win it all back so fast they don’t hardly remember losing. He pays out the last couple of cigarettes and lays down the deck and leans back with a sigh and shoves the cap out of his eyes, and the game is done."
At <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->-> he was sitting on the edge of his bed looking at his watch. He put it to his ear. Then his lips drew back from his teeth in that curious wolf-like smile characteristic of the man. He said very softly:<br>“I think the time has come to do something about this.”
<-<-<-<9.30 p.m.>->->-> Go to bed
"Forty-eight years old, profoundly asleep at <-<-<-<nine thirty>->->-> on a Friday night - this is modern professional life."
"It's <-<-<-<9:30 p.m.>->->-> already. I've gotta head uptown for my appointment with Pavel. Pavel is my shrink. He sees patients at night. He's a Czech Jew, a survivor of Terezin and Auswitz. I see him once a week."
"The light in Mr. Green's kitchen snapped off at <-<-<-<nine-thirty>->->->, followed by the light in his bedroom at his usual ten o'clock. His house was the first on the street to go dark."
"His phone rang at <-<-<-<9:31>->->->. Pat grabbed it, and was relieved to hear Mr. Levy’s voice on the other end of the line."
"I took some juice out of the refrigerator and sat down at the kitchen table with it. On the table was a note from my girlfriend: 'Gone out to eat. Back by 9:30.' The digital clock on the table read 9:30. I watched it flip over to <-<-<-<9:31>->->->, then to 9:32."
"I took some juice out of the refrigerator and sat down at the kitchen table with it. On the table was a note from my girlfriend: 'Gone out to eat. Back by 9:30.' The digital clock on the table read 9:30. I watched it flip over to 9:31, then to <-<-<-<9:32>->->->."
"Geraldine's bus ride back to the sanitarium, in Bensalem Township, would leave at <-<-<-<9:32>->->->. Out of pride, despite the drive taking well over a half hour, she declined to stay until morning."
It must have been about <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes to ten>->->-> when I reached the summer-house. Ralph was waiting for me.
"Thanks; expect me <-<-<-<9.34 p.m.>->->-> 26th; which produced, three hours later, a reply: ""Delighted; please bring a No. 3 Rippingille stove"" - a perplexing and ominous direction, which somehow chilled me in spite of its subject matter."
"The colonel ran to it, jumped in, and drove quickly down the ramp of the Royal Garden Hotel before turning left into Kensington Palace Gardens. Adam checked his watch: <-<-<-<nine thirty-five>->->->."
"Tess looked at her watch and was astounded to see it was only <-<-<-<twenty-five to ten>->->->. It seemed that she had fed Fritzy double rations and left the house four years ago. Maybe five, She thought she heard an approaching engine, then decided she didn’t."
"The Sergeant jotted it down on a piece of paper. ""That checks up with his own story: <-<-<-<9.35 p.m.>->->-> Budd leaves; the North dame arrives."""
It was <-<-<-<9:36>->->-> and the traffic was now flowing smoothly. He walked over to the officer coordinating the shoot for the city’s motion picture and television office.
"My backpack was already packed, and I'd already gotten the other supplies together, like the altimeter and the granola bars and the Swiss army knife I'd dug up in Central Park, so there was nothing else to do. Mom tucked me in at <-<-<-<9:36>->->->."
"What time last night did this happen?<br>""We received the treble nine call at <-<-<-<21:37 hours>->->->,"" he answered, checking his notes.<br>""What made her look in? It's a terrace, was she passing the window?"""
"At <-<-<-<nine thirty-eight>->->-> the waiter came back and offered us a second helping of cheese, salami and sardines, and Mr Yoshogi who had been converting sterling into yen looked extremely puzzled and said he had no idea that British Honduras had so large an export trade"
Fletch looked at his watch. It was <-<-<-<twenty-one minutes to ten>->->->. Instinctively he timed the swiftness of the police.
"The Whistler's fourth victim was his youngest, Valerie Mitchell, aged fifteen years, eight months, and four days, and she died because she missed the <-<-<-<9.40>->->-> bus from Easthaven to Cobb's Marsh."
"Say that again, Sergeant, asked Warren, although he was pretty sure he had heard her correctly the first time.<br>""A Royal Mail postal delivery van drove past a traffic camera at <-<-<-<21:41 hours>->->->, about three quarters of a mile south-west of the sports centre."""
Langdon looked at his Mickey Mouse watch. <-<-<-<9:42 P.M.>->->->
"<-<-<-<9:43 P.M.>->->-><br>""We'll be working together, kid,"" Dore Peretz was saying. ""We're a team."" He swept back his mane of salt-and-pepper hair, then moved next to Georges LeFarge."
"The island fell at <-<-<-<sixteen minutes to ten o'clock>->->-> that January night in 1671, with lots of shouting and screaming and firing of blank musket and arquebus charges, a minimum of rapine and breakage, some."
Hattie would certainly return soon. She wouldn't leave a room for long while Char occupied it.<br>My dance ended as the clock struck <-<-<-<the quarter before ten>->->->.
"But for some unfathomable reason-birth, death, the end of the universe and all things available to man-Cody Menhoff's was closed at <-<-<-<9:45 PM>->->-> on a Thursday..."
"<-<-<-<9:46 P.M.>->->-><br>""But I'm still finishing the trajectory-default analysis I was supposed to do,"" LeFarge said to Dore Peretz, hoping he could stall. ""I'm only half—"""
"“She’s dead,” he confirmed. “It must have been very sudden and with the minimum of pain.” He checked his watch; the time was <-<-<-<9:47>->->->. He covered his patient with a blanket and called for an ambulance."
"Right. . . <-<-<-<nine forty-seven>->->-> and nine forty-eight. They died at the same time.<br>""That's not the same time, Harry.""<br>I waved a hand, impatient."
"For Hunter, who was trained to note times exactly, the final emergency started at <-<-<-<thirteen minutes to ten>->->->."
"Right. . . nine forty-seven and <-<-<-<nine forty-eight>->->->. They died at the same time.<br>""That's not the same time, Harry.""<br>I waved a hand, impatient."
"This is the body I first saw at <-<-<-<nine-forty-eight>->->-> on Friday the fifteenth of October at Innocent House, Innocent Walk, Wapping."
"Look at when TIMETRV was linked.<br>I read the listing. ""May the fifteenth, at <-<-<-<eleven minutes to ten>->->->. So?""<br>""Now look at when the object file was created."" Gib's eyes gleamed."
"He unlocked the door of his cabin, and once he was inside collapsed on to the bed, job done. He checked his watch: <-<-<-<9:50 p.m.>->->-> It was going to be a long wait."
"No, his watch showed <-<-<-<nine-fifty>->->->. They would be coming across the scrubland. He opened the door and moved out into the darkness. There were no stars, and the low cloud-base had hidden even the moon."
"She reaches Radiance at <-<-<-<ten to ten>->->->, early for once, and lets herself in with her key, and puts on the mauve-and-aqua smock that Shanita designed for them so the customers will know they aren’t customers themselves."
"<-<-<-<Nine-fifty>->->-> the residents leave and the machinery hums up smooth again. The nurse watches the day room from her glass case; the scene before her takes on that blue-steel clarity again, that clean orderly movement of a cartoon comedy."
"Philip Lombard said:<br>“What’s the time now?”<br>“<-<-<-<Ten minutes to ten>->->->, sir.”<br>Lombard’s eyebrows rose. He nodded slowly to himself."
I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was <-<-<-<ten minutes to ten>->->->. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name.
"They paused in front of the great concrete blocks that had been built to house the Declaration of Independence, just as a priest might in front of an altar. Scott checked his watch. It was <-<-<-<9:51>->->->."
"<-<-<-<9:51 P.M.>->->-><br>. . . HELLO, SOHO. BLUEBIRD NEEDS A FAVOR. CAN YOU SWITCH ON THE SERVOS?"
"<-<-<-<9:52 P.M.>->->-><br>""Georges is a genius,"" she said, turning back, ""but this may not actually be possible. Nobody's ever done it before."""
People did not speak to her in such a manner. Her father was a lawyer. It was <-<-<-<seven minutes to ten>->->->.
"Danny walked quickly back past the hotel, checking every intersection until he finally saw the name Argyll Street carved in large letters on a stone slab above him. He checked his watch as he turned into the street: <-<-<-<9:54>->->->."
The lamps were still lit in the drive leading to the museum and when she turned the final corner she saw that every window blazed as if the place were preparing for a celebration. She glanced at her watch; <-<-<-<five minutes to ten>->->->. The visiting group would be here already.
At about <-<-<-<five minutes to ten>->->-> Martha had put a saucepan of milk to heat slowly at the side of the stove. This was done most nights at Martingale so that she could get early to bed.
"He reached for his watch and noted that Little Billy's clutch had opened his overcoat. He struck a match and discovered it was <-<-<-<four minutes to ten>->->->—four minutes to reach the next corner. He could make it in two, still it was time he was moving."
"The only two items that stood out on the whole list for Cork were two calls placed from the home of Wilfred Lipinksi, mayor of Aurora, one at <-<-<-<9:57 P.M.>->->-> and another at 10:41 P.M. If Lipinski had teenagers who knew about the party at Valhalla, the calls would not have been odd, but all the Lipinski children were long ago grown and gone, and so Cork wondered."
"Second to last, the inset clock blinks from <-<-<-<21:57>->->-> to 21:58. Napier's eyes sink, newborn sunshine slants through ancient oaks and on a lost river. Look, Joe, herons"
"The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds. ""<-<-<-<Three minutes to ten>->->->,"" he announced."
"Second to last, the inset clock blinks from 21:57 to <-<-<-<21:58>->->->. Napier's eyes sink, newborn sunshine slants through ancient oaks and on a lost river. Look, Joe, herons"
"At <-<-<-<a minute to ten>->->-> the sky came alive with helicopter rotors. As at the Gala site, three choppers brought the potentates, Fortunato, no Enigma Babylon rep this time, and finally Carpathia."
"<-<-<-<9:59 P.M.>->->-><br>As Moreau emerged from the last copse of cypress, he scanned the mountain, towering upward in the moonlit night, and wondered where the bastard would be holed up. There was one obvious place—in the cinderblock control house."
"Shanghai’s clocks were set an hour ahead so the city could ""save daylight"", but the Bai family said: “We go by the old clock.” <-<-<-<Ten o’clock>->->-> to them was eleven to everyone else. Their singing was behind the beat; they couldn’t keep up with the huqin [Chinese string instrument] producing bleak and desolate sounds of life."
"It was at <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> to-day that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then."
"This was a travelling fair, and we can imagine what a faint impression the public address system might have made against the caterwauling of shrieking teens, the clattering of the roller coaster, the thundering of the waltzer, the hollering of hawkers and hucksters, and the pounding basslines of fairground music. By <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> when the noise had subsided, and when most of the revellers had dispersed into the night, no one had come forward to claim the little girl."
"At night, a quiet so vast it seemed it seemed almost to reverberate. Few cars passed on Route 114, and after <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> or so there were none at all. After ten, the part of the world where I had come to rest belonged only to the loons and the wind in the fir trees."
"At <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->, he went to Shinjuku and bought a Fujitsu word processor with his credit card. It was the latest model, far lighter than earlier versions."
"With the exception of the two or three streets, of which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Not a shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows; all lights extinguished by <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->."
"It was <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall."
"On Saturday nights I still sat in the same chair in the dorm lobby. I knew a phone call wouldn’t come, but I had no idea what else to do. I turned on the TV set and pre<-<-<-<ten>->->->ded to watch baseball. And gazed at the indeterminate space between me and the set. I divided that space into two, and again into two. I did this over and over, until I’d made a space so small it could fit in the palm of my hand.<br>At ten I turned off the TV, went back to my room, and went to sleep."
"Anyway, when he looked at his watch again it was <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->. At ten o’clock she was lying on the divan with her boobies in her hands. That’s the way he gives it to me—in driblets."
"And now sometimes, in the very midst of things, sometimes when I feel that I am absolutely free of it all, suddenly, in rounding a corner perhaps, there will bob up a little square, a few trees and a bench, a deserted spot where we stood and had it out, where we drove each other crazy with bitter, jealous scenes. Always some deserted spot, like the Place de l’Estrapade, for example, or those dingy, mournful streets off the Mosque or along that open tomb of an Avenue de Breteuil which at <-<-<-<ten o’clock in the evening>->->-> is so silent, so dead, that it makes one think of murder or suicide, anything that might create a vestige of human drama."
"It was <-<-<-<ten at night>->->-> and everyone had gone home. I trudged up the dark stairway to clean out my desk. There was no sadness or nostalgia, only disgust that I’d wasted so much time on unnecessary labor when I could have been sleeping and feeling nothing. I’d been stupid to believe that employment would add value to my life."
"D-Day. I reported to Ernie’s room thirty minutes after the Undead were put to bed at <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->. “Last chance to back out if you don’t think you can hack it,” the artful Scot told me.<br>“I’ve never backed out of anything in my life,” I replied, lying through my decaying teeth."
“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”<br>“At what time?”<br>“Ten will be early enough.”<br>“I shall be at Baker Street at <-<-<-<ten>->->->.”
"Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.<br>“<-<-<-<Ten o’clock>->->->,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”"
"While everyone ate, and I nibbled, Danièle said, “So this is the plan, Will. We will arrive at the entrance to the catacombs around <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->->. We will continue for four hours, then rest for one. Then it is another two hours or so to the spot where the camera was found.”"
"At <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> she went into her double cell, where the woman she shared with was already asleep, and there was the reassuring clang of the door and click of the lock. It felt safe to be caged in, now that she knew she had this other person inside her who was capable of escapades and contortions she’d never known about before."
"Alone at the too-small child’s desk in her room, Eva finished the last line of the most pointless assignment ever, and though she wanted to start on the evening’s true mission immediately, she kept the box of churro bites closed under her bed. Her parents went to sleep at <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> on weeknights. Only three and a half more hours to wait out."
"<-<-<-<Ten o’clock>->->-> found them penniless. They had suppered greatly on their last eleven cents and, singing, strolled up through the casinos and lighted arches on the boardwalk, stopping to listen approvingly to all band concerts."
"Meanwhile, the blood of the city’s saints had taken on a whole range of properties hitherto unknown to science. One lady’s was liquefying at precisely <-<-<-<ten o’clock>->->-> every Tuesday, while San Giovanni’s bubbled away obligingly whenever it heard Holy Scripture."
He glanced at the clock. <-<-<-<2200 hours>->->->. Getting on toward midnight. He hurried to dress.
"By <-<-<-<ten>->->->, Quoyle was drunk. The crowd was enormous, crushed together so densely that Nutbeem could not force his way down the hall or to the door and urinated on the remaining potato chips in the blue barrel, setting a popular example."
"I could not doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT; and taking it up, I found writ<-<-<-<ten>->->-> on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: ""You have till ten tonight."""
"I went back into the library, limp and exhausted. In a few minutes the telephone began ringing again. I did not do anything. I let it ring. I went and sat down at Maxim's feet. It went on ringing. I did not move. Presently it stopped, as though cut suddenly in exasperation. The clock on the mantelpiece struck <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->->. Maxim put his arms round me and lifted me against him. We began to kiss one another, feverishly, desperately, like guilty lovers who have not kissed before."
"No one wanted to go to bed when at <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->-> Mrs. March put by the last finished job, and said, ""Come girls."" Beth went to the piano and played the father's favorite hymn."
The grandfather clock in the State Room strikes <-<-<-<ten>->->-> times.
"The light in Mr. Green's kitchen snapped off at nine-thirty, followed by the light in his bedroom at his usual <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->->. His house was the first on the street to go dark."
"They were alone then, and theoretically free to do whatever they wanted, but they went on eating the dinner they had no appetite for. Florence set down her knife and reached for Edward's hand and squeezed. From downstairs they heard the wireless, the chimes of Big Ben at the start of the <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->-> news."
"We let our upstairs room to a certain Mr. Goudsmit, a divorced man in his thirties, who appeared to have nothing to do on this particular evening; we simply could not get rid of him without being rude; he hung about until <-<-<-<ten o'clock>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<one minute past ten>->->->, Giles shook the last hand and, desperate for a drink, walked down the road to join the dock workers in the Lord Nelson."

"The first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle Toby upstairs, which was <-<-<-<about 10>->->-> - Mrs. Wadman threw herself into her arm chair"
It was now <-<-<-<10.02 pm>->->->. He has less than two hours.
"At <-<-<-<10.03 pm>->->-> the ushers pull open the doors and I watch the now-familiar footage of the audience surging into the night, noticeably excited."
"On Saturday. November 12. 1955, the Hill Valley Courthouses clock tower was struck by lightning, which poured 1.21 gigawatts of energy into the structure. Time stood still at <-<-<-<10:04>->->-> on the clock's face from that day on,"
"The A-B elevator was our elevator, the elevator on which the paramedics came up at 9:20 p.m., the elevator on which they took John (and me) downstairs to the ambulance at <-<-<-<10:05 p.m.>->->->"
"If you do not tell me everything I need to know by-he looked at the watch on his wrist-""by <-<-<-<ten-oh-five>->->-> tomorrow night, you will be executed. You and the three exnays."""
"Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it was long <-<-<-<after ten o'clock>->->-> and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed."
Let me know as soon as you hear anything.<br>Quoyle shivered in the chilly kitchen. The clock said <-<-<-<six minutes past ten>->->->. He could not hear the sea.
"<-<-<-<22:06 CET>->->-><br>William settled down on his bunk just after ten, but he didn't sleep. Some of the deckhands were playing cards, while others told unlikely tales of treasure they had recovered from the bottom of the ocean."
"“Follow the diversion sign,” he said, without even looking at her.<br>She glanced at the clock on her dashboard. It was <-<-<-<10:07>->->->."
"<-<-<-<10:07 P.M.>->->-><br>She felt the straps on the gurney loosening and then she started prying her eyes open. She thought, hoped, it was Stone, but she couldn't see well enough to be absolutely sure. Her mind and her vision were still overflowing with horrifying nightmares of time gone awry. What did all those bizarre dreams mean?"
"Chief Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh turned from his inspection of the dead girl's clothes, his six feet two inches uncomfortably trapped between the foot of the bed and the wardrobe door. He looked at his watch. It was <-<-<-<eight minutes past ten>->->->."
"My watch is always a little fast, I said. ""What time do you make it now?""<br>""<-<-<-<Ten eight>->->->.""<br>""Ten eighteen by mine. You see."""
The hour was <-<-<-<nine minutes past ten>->->->. My teeth began to chatter of sheer excitement.
"That was the past, and now I had just died on the narrow couch of a Paris lodging house, and my wife was crouching on the floor, crying bitterly. The white light before my left eye was growing dim, but I remembered the room perfectly. On the left there was a chest of drawers, on the right a mantelpiece surmounted by a damaged clock without a pendulum, the hands of which marked <-<-<-<ten minutes past ten>->->->. The window overlooked the Rue Dauphine, a long, dark street. All Paris seemed to pass below, and the noise was so great that the window shook."
At about ten o’clock the first tiny snowflakes came loitering down and settled on Jill’s arm. <-<-<-<Ten minutes later>->->-> they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground was noticeably white.
But all of his senses were heightened when the knock at the hotel door came. He looked at the clock: <-<-<-<10:11 PM>->->->.
Therefore a sergeant called Trifonov had been on post all day or all week and then he had left at <-<-<-<eleven minutes past ten>->->-> in the evening.

"Still unable to sleep, Tengo was sitting on the floor, listening to the Duke Ellington record at low volume, when the phone rang again. The hands on the wall clock were pointing to <-<-<-<10:12>->->->."
"The Chinese women scuttled at an amazing rate, given their size and the bags' size. It was c. <-<-<-<2212>->->->:30-40h., smack in the middle of the former Interval of Issues Resolution."
"It's <-<-<-<ten-thirteen>->->->, announced Clancy. ""In two more minutes-""<br>""Post time,"" I said."
"The shopping bags looked heavy and impressive, their weight making the Chinese women lean in slightly towards each other. Call it <-<-<-<2214>->->->:10h."
"Domino two had me standing sentinel in Mr. Meek’s room watching through the crack in the door. Due to his advanced state of decay, our loyal boiler room mascot wasn’t in on the great escape, but his room was opposite mine, and he understood “Shush!” At <-<-<-<a quarter past ten>->->-> Ernie went to Reception to announce my death to Nurse Noakes."
Aargh. Is <-<-<-<10:15>->->->. Newsnight in 15 minutes.
"Nevertheless, when you left me a message, at <-<-<-<22.16>->->-> according to Telenor - in other words as soon as you had got in the door - you were obviously pretty excited that you were on the track of something."
"The doctor came into the waiting room at <-<-<-<ten seventeen>->->-> that night.<br>Charity came to her feet. She'd spent much of the day with her head bowed, praying quietly. She was beyond tears, at least for the moment, and she put a sheltering arm around her daughter, pulling Molly in close to her side."
"It was already <-<-<-<seventeen minutes past ten>->->-> when Phil closed the door and turned out the light on the landing, but I knew I couldn’t leave straight away."
<-<-<-<10:17 p.m.>->->-> Casette will not go in.
"My watch is always a little fast, I said. ""What time do you make it now?""<br>""Ten eight.""<br>""<-<-<-<Ten eighteen>->->-> by mine. You see."""
<-<-<-<10:18 p.m.>->->-> Ah. Thelma and Louise is in there.
<-<-<-<10:19 p.m.>->->-> Thelma and Louise will not come out.
"<-<-<-<22:19 GMT>->->-><br>Jackie decided that this was even worse than a stakeout, because they were waiting for someone who wasn't there, rather than for someone who was there and must eventually show up."
The clock on the wall in the institute's bullpen ticked past <-<-<-<10:20 PM>->->->. Helen Pomeroy and Pastor Eric Meyer looked across her desk at each other. They had just discussed the bizarre events that had unfolded on this day.
"A May wind, swelling up like a piece of fruit, with a rough outer skin, slimy flesh, dozens of seeds. The flesh split open in midair, spraying seeds like gentle buckshot into the bare skin of my arms, leaving behind a faint trace of pain.<br>“What time is it?” my cousin asked me. About eight inches shorter than me, he had to look up when he talked.<br>I glanced at my watch. “<-<-<-<Ten twenty>->->->.”"
"At <-<-<-<10:20>->->-> she returned with a shopping bag from the supermarket. In the bag were three scrub brushes, one box of paperclips and a well-chilled six-pack of canned beer. So I had another beer.<br>""It was about sheep,"" I said.<br>""Didn't I tell you?"" she said."
At about ten o’clock the first tiny snowflakes came loitering down and settled on Jill’s arm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. <-<-<-<In twenty minutes>->->-> the ground was noticeably white.
<-<-<-<10:21 p.m.>->->-> Frenziedly press all buttons. Cassette comes out and goes back in again.
"On a Saturday c. <-<-<-<2221h>->->->., Lenz found a miniature bird that had fallen out of some nest and was sitting bald and pencil-necked on the lawn of Unit #3 flapping ineffectually."
"It was now just <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes past ten>->->->. They had been absent from the platoon for less than half an hour but, with the inferno raging at the compnay stores, both men were keenly aware that they had to get back to their men without delay."
"The mask leered at him out of a dark case. He hurried on to the next station, where he turned a key in a box. The box recorded the time: <-<-<-<10:23 P.M.>->->->"
"Nevertheless, I love her. I loved her from the first moment I beheld her; and that was at an evening-party in Mayfair, at precisely <-<-<-<twenty-four minutes past ten o'clock>->->-> on Thursday evening, the twenty-fourth of December, eighteen hundred and sixty-two."
"Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by <-<-<-<10:24>->->-> the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident."
Mrs. Bultitaft always puts on the hot milk at ten. At about <-<-<-<twenty-five minutes after>->->-> we saw Sally carrying her mug up to her room.
"Dalgliesh reflected that Etienne could hardly have devised a more effective deterrent to visitors and for a moment he wondered whether to walk the half-mile rather than risk his suspension. Glancing at his watch, he saw that it was <-<-<-<10:25>->->->. He would arrive precisely on time."
"“The last phone call came at <-<-<-<ten twenty-five p.m.>->->-> that night when I was listening to Erroll Garner’s Concert by the Sea and drinking Seagram’s VO. Handy, isn’t it, keeping a diary like this?”"
"<-<-<-<10:25 p.m.>->->-> Have got new cassette in now. Right. Turn to ""Recording."""
"Siddons shuffled through some papers before he found the document he was looking for. He looked up at the judge and said, “I can confirm, sir, that the death certificate was signed at <-<-<-<ten twenty-six p.m.>->->-> on Thursday the twenty-sixth of July, 1951.”"
"As always, consciousness returned to me progressively from the edges of my field of vision. The first things to claim recognition were the bathroom door emerging from the far right and a lamp from the far left, from which my awareness gradually drifted inward like ice flowing together toward the middle of a lake. In the exact center of my visual field was the alarm clock, hands pointing to <-<-<-<ten-twenty-six>->->->."
"“Should you be having caffeine at”—Olive glanced at the clock—“<-<-<-<ten twenty-seven p.m.>->->->?” Come to think of it, he shouldn’t be having caffeine at all, given his baseline shiny personality. And yet the two of them got coffee together every Wednesday. Olive was nothing but an enabler."
"Mr. Harcourt woke up with mysterious suddenness at <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes past 10>->->->, and, by a curious coincidence, it was at that very instant that the butler came in with two footmen laden with trays of whisky, brandy, syphons, glasses and biscuits."
"On Tuesday night, at <-<-<-<twenty-eight minutes past ten o'clock>->->->, the Associated Press calls New York City's most closely contested mayoral race in decades for Councilman O'Malley."
"Even when I had to say something, the right words just wouldn’t come out. And every time I hesitated, every time I swallowed back something I was about to say, my cousin looked at me with a slightly confused look on his face. His left ear tilted ever so slightly toward me.<br>“What time is it now?” he asked me.<br>“<-<-<-<Ten twenty nine>->->->,” I replied."
"Still, despite her endless consternation, for the third night in a row she slipped out at <-<-<-<half past ten>->->-> and made her way to the edge of the estate, where Aleandro would wait for her near an abandoned wine cellar, which had become their meeting place."
"They have their first fight at <-<-<-<ten-thirty>->->-> that night. It’s over who’s going to sleep in the bed and who’s going to sleep on the couch. Billy insists that she take the bed, says he’ll be fine on the couch.<br>“That’s sexist.”<br>“Sleeping on the couch is sexist? Are you kidding me?”<br>“Being a manly man is sexist. You’re too long for it. Your feet will hang out on the floor.”"
"“What are you getting?” He addressed this to the air in front of him, without turning toward her.<br>“I’m sorry?”<br>“I’ve been sent for ice,” he said. “What do you need?”<br>“Oh, nothing. I’m off home.”<br>“At <-<-<-<ten thirty>->->-> on New Year’s Eve? That is either the saddest or the wisest thing I’ve ever heard.”"
"At <-<-<-<ten thirty>->->->, Kendra found herself on the couch again, this time with Christy. She felt uncomfortable sitting next to her, especially after the barrage of hate her coworkers had thrown at the blonde, but Christy seemed unusually approachable right then, all smiles and laughs and easy-flowing gestures."
"She looked at the clock; it was <-<-<-<ten thirty>->->->. If she could get there quickly on the subway, then she could be at his house in less than an hour, maybe a bit longer if the late trains did not come so often."
"The time was <-<-<-<ten-thirty>->->-> but it could have been three in the morning, because along its borders, West Berlin goes to bed with the dark"
"From the untoward lateness of the hour at which the dose was administered, it was <-<-<-<half past ten o’clock>->->-> before any effects began to show themselves in this case."
<-<-<-<10:31 p.m.>->->-> OK. OK. Calm. Penny Husbands-Bosworth's asbestos leukemia item is not on yet.
"And later on, at <-<-<-<10.31 p.m.>->->-> I went out onto the balcony to find out whether I could see any stars, but there weren't any because of all the clouds and what is called light pollution, which is light from streetlights and car headlights and floodlights and lights in buildings reflecting off tiny particles in the atmosphere and getting in the way of light from the stars. So I went back inside."
"It was <-<-<-<ten thirty-two>->->-> when the bus finally rolled into view.<br>The bus that came was a new type, not like the one I used to take to high school."
"He looked at his watch: <-<-<-<10.33>->->->. He remembered being told, he couldn't recall when or by whom, that it was her practice to take her nightly swim shortly after nine o'clock."
"<-<-<-<10:33 p.m.>->->-> Yesss, yesss. RECORDING CURRENT PROGRAM. Have done it!<br>Aargh. All going mad. Cassette has started rewinding and now stopped and ejected. Why? Shit. Shit. Realize in excitement have sat on remote control."
"If you please. You went to bed at what time, Madame?<br>""<-<-<-<Just after half past ten.>->->->"""
"“What time does the concert end?” he asked the first uniformed official he spotted.<br>“<-<-<-<Ten thirty-five>->->->, sir, but you can’t leave your car there.”"
"<-<-<-<Five-and-twenty to eleven>->->->. A horrible hour - a macabre hour, for it is not only the hour of pleasure ended, it is the hour when pleasure itself has been found wanting."
"If he did not return in fourteen minutes he would have lingered. She looked at the clock. It was <-<-<-<twenty-five minutes to eleven>->->->. He might enter the inn with Arabella, as they would reach it before closing time; she might get him to drink with<br>her; and Heaven only knew what disasters would befall him then."
"<-<-<-<10:35 p.m.>->->-> Frantic now. Have rung Shazzer, Rebecca, Simon, Magda. Nobody knows how to programme their videos. Only person I know who knows how to do it is Daniel."
Our take-off time was <-<-<-<22.36>->->-> and as I lifted the heavy plane into the starlit night my hands and stomach felt as cold as ice.
"At <-<-<-<10:37 p.m.>->->-> that night a fireball rips through Obscurity, killing Cripps but not before he's called Goldilocks and left a message about something being 'full of holes.'"
Just a click as someone hung up the phone. It had been left at <-<-<-<22.38>->->-> the previous evening. Jack didn't have much doubt that it was someone checking to see if he was in.
"Sunday, April 5<br><-<-<-<10:39 P.M.>->->-><br>""I didn't know if I should have brought a bodyguard"" he was saying as he strode in the door, a Master of the Universe with a leather jacket slung over his shoulder."
"She climbed into bed at <-<-<-<10:40>->->->, but couldn’t sleep for more than an hour at a time. She occasionally flicked on the television to watch spaghetti Westerns dubbed into Lebanese."
"There, at <-<-<-<10:40>->->->, the plasma engines would ignite at full burn to start the rapid straight-line acceleration that would give them the ten-thousand-kilometers-an-hour speed needed to coast quickly along the Normal-Space tunnel linking the Gates."
"“My friend,” she said with a pleased tone to her voice that she knew he could not mistake. She didn’t care, she was pleased to hear from him, even if it was <-<-<-<ten-forty at night>->->->. “Where are you calling from?” she asked, expecting him to say Glasgow or Berlin."
"When fifteen minutes have passed and the bogus DPW truck hasn’t returned, Billy decides they have either moved on to another part of the city, maybe to check out the house on Evergreen Street, or have gone back to the McMansion to await further orders from Nick. He closes the curtain, shutting out the view, and looks at his watch. <-<-<-<It’s twenty to eleven>->->->. How time flies when you’re having fun, he thinks."
"The station clock told him the time: <-<-<-<twenty to eleven>->->->. He went to the booking office and asked the clerk in a polite tone when was the next train to Paris. ""In twelve minutes."""
William listened to a debate on the future of Trident between Tony Blair and Michael Heseltine—both regarded as potential future leaders of their respective parties—when the lights went out in Summers’s living room at <-<-<-<10:41>->->->. He turned the radio off and made another entry in his notebook.
"The only two items that stood out on the whole list for Cork were two calls placed from the home of Wilfred Lipinksi, mayor of Aurora, one at 9:57 P.M. and another at <-<-<-<10:41 P.M.>->->-> If Lipinski had teenagers who knew about the party at Valhalla, the calls would not have been odd, but all the Lipinski children were long ago grown and gone, and so Cork wondered."
"He climbed into the front seat and started the car. It started with a merry powerful hum, ready to go. ""There, the bastards"", said Julian, and smashed the clock with the bottom of the bottle, to give them an approximate time. It was <-<-<-<10:41>->->->."
"We have established the exact time that Janisohn fell to the stage, the knife in his neck. It was <-<-<-<eighteen minutes to eleven>->->->."
Sebastian checked his watch: <-<-<-<10:43 p.m.>->->-> “Then let’s go and find out if he’s still awake.”
"Tuesday <-<-<-<10:43 P.M.>->->-><br>Michael Vance, Eva Borodin, and Aleksei Novosty were luckier than they knew. When they emerged, the Japanese guard Jiro Sato had stationed at the Burleigh entrance had momentarily been called away by radio to confer at the Strand corner."
"Alec pricked up his ears. ""When was that?""<br>""Oh, yesterday evening.""<br>""What time?""<br>""<-<-<-<About a quarter to eleven>->->->. I was playing bridge."""
"At the words, “One thousand pounds to the person who unmasks Lady Whistledown,” the clock read <-<-<-<forty-four minutes past ten>->->->."
"Char saw me. Over the shoulder of his partner, he mouthed, ""Wait for me.""<br>I grew roots. An earthquake could not have moved me. The clock struck <-<-<-<a quarter before eleven>->->->. It struck eleven. If it had struck the end of the world, I'd have stayed as I was."
"<-<-<-<10:45 p.m.>->->-> Oh God. Daniel fell about laughing when I said I could not program video. Said he would do it for me. Still, at least I have done best for Mum. It is exciting and historic when one's friends are on TV."
So the Lackadaisical Broadcasting Co. bids you farewell with the message that if you aren't grateful to be living in a world where so many things to be grateful for are yours as a matter of course. Why it is now five seconds until <-<-<-<fifteen minutes before eleven>->->-> o'clock and you are just an old Trojan Horse.
"The 'night train' tallied to perfection, for high tide in the creek would be, as Davies estimated, between 10.30 and 11.00 p.m.on the night of the 25th; and the time-table showed that the only night train arriving at Norden was one from the south at <-<-<-<10.46 p.m.>->->->"
"OLIVE: [At KATHERINE'S elbow—examining her watch on its stand] It's <-<-<-<fourteen minutes to eleven>->->->.<br>KATHERINE: Olive, Olive!<br>OLIVE: I just wanted to see the time. I never can go to sleep if I try—it's quite helpless, you know. Is there a victory yet? [KATHERINE, shakes her head] Oh! I prayed extra special for one in the evening papers."
On my screen the remaining theatregoers slowly drift away and when the timestamp clicks over to <-<-<-<10.47 pm>->->-> there is no one left.
"Oh! I don't know about that, said Mr. Satterthwaite, warming to his subject. ""I was down there for a bit last summer. I found it quite convenient for town. Of course the trains only go every hour. 48 minutes past the hour from Waterloo-up to <-<-<-<10.48>->->->."""
"It's <-<-<-<well after 2245h>->->->. The dog's leash slides hissing to the end of the Day-Glo line and stops the dog a couple of paces from the inside of the gate, where Lenz is standing, inclined in the slight forward way of somebody who's talking baby-talk to a dog."
<-<-<-<10:49 P.M.>->->-><br>Sabri Ramirez stood watching as the last of the krytron detonators was secured in the ganglia of wiring that surrounded the explosive Octol sphere. Now one of the bombs was armed. He liked the looks of it.
"<-<-<-<10.50 P. M.>->->-> This diary-keeping of mine is, I fancy, the outcome of that scientific habit of mind about which I wrote this morning. I like to register impressions while they are fresh."
"Saturday night. And I said, ""It's a hundred this year, ain't anybody noticed?"" Jack said, ""What's a hundred?"" I said, ""Pub is. Coach is. Look at the clock."" Jack said, ""It's <-<-<-<ten to eleven>->->->""."
"So think yourself lucky while you're awake and remember a happy crew. Think of Hamburg on the Magic Night. <-<-<-<22.50>->->-> and they went out neatly, just as they should - you couldn't fault Parks, he was always on his route."
At <-<-<-<nine minutes to eleven>->->-> the door of the house across the road opened. I knelt up in bed and peered out the window. It was Frau Gustavsen; she was walking across the drive with a garbage bag in her hand.
"Now the player's fever was in Rawley's eyes. His face was deadly pale, but his hand threw steadily, calmly, almost negligently, as it might seem. All at once, at <-<-<-<eight minutes to eleven>->->->, the luck turned in his favour, and his pile mounted again."
"Every time I was there I saw you sitting at the end of the bar all by yourself, hunched over a cup of coffee. And every night at exactly <-<-<-<seven minutes to eleven>->->-> you threw money on the bar, grabbed your coat, and headed out the door as fast as you were able."
"They had a listing for Ozgard, Ramsey G., in the city. It was <-<-<-<10:54>->->-> in Colorado, but the hour might make the call seem more urgent and therefore more credible."
All she could tell me was that she'd gone to sleep shortly after listening to the Dvorak String Quartet at <-<-<-<ten fifty-five>->->-> - they had twin beds - and didn't stir until her husband woke her with news of the murder.
"At <-<-<-<10:55>->->-> they would enter the Farholme Gate, emerging a mere ten and a half minutes later at Bannermere Gate. Forty light-years away."
"It is eleven o'clock! <-<-<-<Eleven o'clock, all but five minutes!>->->-><br>""But which eleven o'clock?""<br>""The eleven o'clock that is to decide life or death!...He told me so just before he went....He is terrible....He is quite mad: he tore off his mask and his yellow eyes shot flames!..."""
Mr. Justice Wargrave said:<br>“It is now <-<-<-<five minutes to eleven>->->->. I think we should summon Miss Brent to join our conclave.”
The watch showed <-<-<-<10.56 p.m.>->->-> That meant I had been out for twenty minutes. Twenty minutes' sleep. Just a nice doze. In that time I had muffed a mob and lost eight thousand dollars.
It was <-<-<-<about eleven o'clock>->->->. The stars were shining. The wind blew softly and carried the scent of decaying leaves and melting snow from the fields.
"There they stopped engines and lay side by side upon the water for a few minutes, perhaps five miles from the fishing fleet, and between them and Douarnenez. At <-<-<-<22.57>->->-> they started up main engines and turned to do their stuff."
"Then it grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and, <-<-<-<just about eleven o’clock>->->->, the door-latch was raised quietly, and in stepped the master."
"So when are they going?<br>""Sunday night. I'm driving them down to Norwich to catch the eight-thirty, getting into Liverpool Street at <-<-<-<ten-fifty-eight>->->->. Their daughter will meet them."""
"They parked the car outside Lowther's at precisely <-<-<-<one minute to eleven>->->->. People were leaving, not all of them happy at having their evening curtailed. But the grumbling was muted, and even then it only started once they were safely on the street."
"For the rest of the evening, nobody talked. They just drank, ate, sat in different parts of the shack. Sarah bit her nails, pretended to be busy at the food table. Kendra sat on the couch, her knees pulled up, her head in her arms. Christy stood by the window, examining the rain, her arms crossed, her face pinched.<br>At <-<-<-<10:59 P.M.>->->->, Kendra’s walkie-talkie beeped."
"Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing <-<-<-<one minute to eleven>->->->."
"At <-<-<-<eleven>->->-> o‘clock the dogs gave Mrs. Dearly’s hand one last kiss and took Mr. Dearly out for his last run. Perdita joined them for this. She had spent the evening with the Nannies, feeling that Pongo and Missis might wish to be alone with their pets."
"Shanghai’s clocks were set an hour ahead so the city could ""save daylight"", but the Bai family said: “We go by the old clock.” Ten o’clock to them was <-<-<-<eleven>->->-> to everyone else. Their singing was behind the beat; they couldn’t keep up with the huqin [Chinese string instrument] producing bleak and desolate sounds of life."
"Tony and Zenia are having coffee, as they have done almost every third day now for the past month, ever since they met. Or not every third day, every third evening: right now it’s <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->->, Tony’s usual bedtime, and here she is, still up. She isn’t even sleepy."
"It was nearly <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->-> when we reached this final stage of our night’s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the west-ward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts."
"There was no end to it. At first I made all the proper noises to show her I was following along, but soon gave up. I put on a record and when it was over, I lifted up the needle and put on another. After I finished all the records, I put the first one back on. Outside it was still pouring. Time passed slowly as her monologue went on without end.<br>I didn’t worry about it, though, until a while later. Suddenly I realized it was <-<-<-<eleven p.m.>->->-> and she had been talking nonstop for four hours."
"At <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->-> it was all settled; they were going to run away, to Borneo. F*** the husband! She never loved him anyway. She would never have written the first letter if the husband wasn’t old and passionless."
"I liked to think I’d chosen Dr. Tuttle at random, that there was something fated about our relationship, divine in some way, but in truth, she’d been the only psychiatrist to answer the phone at <-<-<-<eleven at night>->->-> on a Tuesday."
"Around <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->-> the door was unlocked. I readied myself to reject apologies and go for the jugular. A once stately woman sailed in. Seventy years old, eighty, eighty-five, who knows when they’re that old? A rickety greyhound in a blazer followed his mistress."
"There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.<br>“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”<br>“Nearly <-<-<-<eleven>->->->.”"
"She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->-> she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.<br>Tell me, Helen,"" said she, ""have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?""<br>""Never,"" said I."""
"Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of <-<-<-<eleven>->->->, a single bright light shone out right in front of us."
"Five months ago, Ashley had shown up at Hud’s Airstream at <-<-<-<eleven o’clock at night>->->-> and said, “I broke up with him. And I think you should know that I love you.”"
"Around <-<-<-<eleven>->->-> she and Stan have another doughnut. Then they make a hopeful stop at a dumpster out behind a soup joint, but no luck, the stuff has already been picked over."
"It was Eli, Bryan’s friend, the taller of the two. Jaidee reached for his hand, shook it. “Hi,” he said.<br>“Where you going?” Eli said. In a pink polo and khaki shorts, he looked bright against the wide panel of night. His eyes were happy, altered, no doubt, from liquor.<br>“I’m heading back,” he said.<br>Eli looked at his watch. “It’s only <-<-<-<eleven>->->->.”<br>“I’m just tired,” Jaidee said. “Long day.”"
"“That priest of yours is really funny. Did you know that they’re allowed to drink, these priests? No women, but alcohol is fine!” Bahar walked in waving Father Mahoney’s order. Her usually skittish eyes were bright and—dared Marjan hope?—happy?<br>“They drink beer like water here. Last Saturday I saw an entire family, with young kids, leaving the bar next door. At <-<-<-<eleven at night>->->->!”"
"But time passed, two hours of it, and the less subtle beaux had better learned to focus their pseudo-passionate glances elsewhere, for <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->-> found Isabelle and Amory sitting on the couch in the little den off the reading-room up-stairs. She was conscious that they were a handsome pair, and seemed to belong distinctively in this seclusion, while lesser lights fluttered and chattered down-stairs."
“Your detention will take place at <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->-> tonight.<br>Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.”
"He will be here <-<-<-<at eleven>->->-> exactly, sir.<br>At the bar, naked couples had begun dancing."
"At <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->-> that night, having secured a bed at one of the hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival, he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne."
"At <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->->, I rang the bell for Betteredge, and told Mr. Blake that he might at last prepare himself for bed."
"He says, ""They've killed Jan. Clear out.""<br>""The suitcase?"" I ask.<br>""Take it away again. We want nothing to do with it now. Catch the <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->-> express.""<br>""But it doesn't stop here....""<br>""It will. Go to track six. Opposite the freight station. You have three minutes.""<br>""But...""<br>""Move, or I'll have to arrest you."""
"The clock struck <-<-<-<eleven>->->->. I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers."
The train arrived in New York <-<-<-<at eleven>->->-> that night.
They didn't even sit down to eat until <-<-<-<2300h>->->->.
"I left the narration of my story while we were still walking toward the doctor’s. At length, reaching there, we found him still sitting in his office, although it was now <-<-<-<eleven o’clock>->->->."
"When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at <-<-<-<eleven o'clock>->->->, they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still."
"I gazed at him. then, as it dawned on me that he wasn't joking, I looked at all the little clocks on the kitchen appliances. They all agreed: <-<-<-<one minute past eleven>->->->."
"“Yes.” Perena’s firm tone brooked no argument. “It exploded at 11:07. You would have entered at <-<-<-<11:02>->->->, so that by then you would have been exactly midway between the Gates.”"
"I ended the call. I looked in Recents to make sure I HAD called. His number was there, along with the time - <-<-<-<11:02 P.M.>->->-> I turned off my phone and put it on the night table. I turned off my lamp and was asleep almost at once."
"What makes you think it's for real?<br>""Just a hunch, really. He sounded for real. Sometimes you can just tell about people""-he smiled-""even if you're a dull old WASP.""<br>""I think it's a setup.""<br>""Why?""<br>""I just do. Why would someone from the government want to help you?""<br>""Good question. Guess I'll find out.""<br>She went back into the kitchen.""What time are you meeting him?"" she called out.<br>""<-<-<-<Eleven oh-three>->->->,"" he said. ""That made me think he's for real. Military and intelligence types set precise appointment times to eliminate confusion and ambiguity. Nothing ambiguous about eleven oh-three."""
"He came out of his reverie and noticed on the digital clock that it was already <-<-<-<four minutes past eleven>->->->. As he began switching channels, he cursed himself, cursed his weakness, and cursed the satanic forces that were loose in this accursed land."
"Gates glanced at his clock on the nightstand. It was <-<-<-<11:05>->->->. ""Trey and his friends have probably been done talking about tropical fish for about a half hour. But he's used to me coming home late."" She smiled. ""So, no rush."""
<-<-<-<Five past eleven>->->->; less than a quarter of an hour before Amethyst either succeeded or failed
"It was <-<-<-<11.05>->->->, five minutes later than my habitual bedtime. I felt. I felt guilty at being still up, but the past kept pricking at me and I knew that all the events of those nineteen days in July were astir within me, like the loosening phlegm in an attack of bronchitis"
"It was <-<-<-<five minutes past eleven>->->-> when I made my last entry. I remember winding up my watch and noting the time. So I have wasted some five hours of the little span still left to us. Who would have believed it possible? But I feel very much fresher, and ready for my fate--or try to persuade myself that I am. And yet, the fitter a man is, and the higher his tide of life, the more must he shrink from death. How wise and how merciful is that provision of nature by which his earthly anchor is usually loosened by many little imperceptible tugs, until his consciousness has drifted out of its untenable earthly harbor into the great sea beyond!"
My watch says <-<-<-<11:05>->->->. But whether AM or PM I don't know.
"He looked at the large clock on the wall and saw that it was <-<-<-<six minutes past eleven o'clock>->->->, local time. That was as it should have been."
"“Yes.” Perena’s firm tone brooked no argument. “It exploded at <-<-<-<11:07>->->->. You would have entered at 11:02, so that by then you would have been exactly midway between the Gates.”"
"At <-<-<-<11:07 p.m.>->->->, Samuel ""Gunner"" Wilson was moving at 645 miles per hour over the Mojave Desert. Up ahead in the moonlight, he saw the twin lead jets, their afterburners glowing angrily in the night sky."
He glanced up so that he could see the time on the datastrip along the upper edge of his helmet: <-<-<-<11:08>->->->:23. Ten minutes. They walked unsteadily on.
"“This is my first pass,” Wilson said. “East to west, at <-<-<-<11:08>->->->. We’re looking from the left-wing camera which is running at ninety-six frames per second. As you can see, my altitude is falling rapidly.”"
"The time is <-<-<-<11:09>->->-> at that point, Powell said to the D.A.'s staff. ""Watch the clock above the model. It's geared to synchronize with the slow motion.""<br>In rapt silence, the legal division studied the scene and jotted notes while the androids reproduced the actions of the fatal Beaumont party."
"So that was how I spent Christmas night from about <-<-<-<ten past eleven>->->-> until nearly two in the morning, playing endless games of cards, listening to Wagner and Beethoven, hearing the crackle and hiss of burning logs as I kept up the fire, watching my cousin drink steadily until the whisky bottle was empty."
"She backed down the driveway, checked for traffic, and turned toward the turnpike. <-<-<-<Ten past eleven>->->->. Plenty of time.<br>That’s what she thought then."
"Another Christmas day is nearly over. It's <-<-<-<ten past eleven>->->->. Richard declined with thanks my offer to make up a bed for him here in my study, and has driven off back to Cambridge, so I am able to make some notes on the day before going to bed myself."
"He had not the strength to help himself, and at <-<-<-<ten minutes past eleven>->->-> no one could have helped him, no one in the world"
The last recorded call on the victim's cell phone was Sunday night at <-<-<-<eleven-eleven P.M.>->->-> Nobody's seen her since that night.
"Life changes fast. Life changes in an instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The Question of self-pity. Those were the first words I wrote after it happened. The computer dating on the Microsoft Word file (""Notes on change.doc"") reads ""May 20, 2004, <-<-<-<11:11 p.m.>->->->,"" but that would have been a case of my opening the file and reflexively pressing save when I closed it. I had made no changes to that file since I wrote the words, in January 2004, a day or two after the fact. For a long time I wrote nothing else. Life changes in the instant. The ordinary instant."
Then they texted me at <-<-<-<eleven twelve p.m.>->->-> to say they’d found nothing and were going home for the night.
There was a confirmatory identification done by undercover officer 6475 at <-<-<-<23:12>->->-> hours at the corner of 147th and Amsterdam.
"Vero smiled. “I t-take that as approval. So let me summarize. On its present trajectory and speed, the Blade of Night will pass behind the moon between <-<-<-<11:13>->->-> and 11:22 p.m. Jerusalem time on the night of the seventeenth of February. That’s four days away. It will be sufficiently close that the moon will fully cover the disk of the earth at 11:18. That’s vital.”"
"When they’d finished their burgers, Melissa glanced at her watch, a big plastic digital thing that looked like it should belong to a child.<br>“<-<-<-<Eleven fourteen>->->->,” Melissa said. “We’ve still got forty-four minutes to kill before the end of the world.”"
"The chalet stand isolated at the end of a blind valley. Higher up, there’s only the reservoir, and behind it the treacherous glacier. At <-<-<-<a quarter past eleven>->->->, she concludes that it’s impossible for Nick to be wandering out there, in this weather."
"We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:<br>Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the <-<-<-<11:15>->->->."
"<-<-<-<11:15 p.m.>->->-> Humph. Mum just rang. ""Sorry, darling. It isn't Newsnight, it's Breakfast News tomorrow. Could you set it for seven o'clock tomorrow morning, BBC1?"""
"On arriving home at a <-<-<-<quarter-past eleven>->->->, we found a hansom cab, which had been waiting for me for two hours with a letter. Sarah said she did not know what to do, as we had not left the address where we had gone."
"The impulse seized me to look again. The minute-hand stood half way <-<-<-<between fifteen and sixteen minutes past eleven>->->->. The watch must have stopped; I held it to my ear; no, it was still going."
"Eventually, at <-<-<-<11:16>->->->, he did show up, and took his reserved place at the baccarat table. Stephen stopped sipping his tomato juice and Jean-Pierre moved over and waited patiently by the table for one of the men seated on the left or right of Harvey to leave."
"But I couldn't get out of the house straightaway because he would see me, so I would have to wait until he was asleep.<br>The time was <-<-<-<11.16 p.m.>->->-><br>I tried doubling 2s again, but I couldn't get past 2(15) which was 32,768. So I groaned to make the time pass quicker and not think."
"Merral, trying to free his head, glimpsed the time on his helmet datastrip. <-<-<-<11:17>->->->:45. Less than a minute. They will be sending out the solar flare warnings now."
"Vero smiled. “I t-take that as approval. So let me summarize. On its present trajectory and speed, the Blade of Night will pass behind the moon between 11:13 and 11:22 p.m. Jerusalem time on the night of the seventeenth of February. That’s four days away. It will be sufficiently close that the moon will fully cover the disk of the earth at <-<-<-<11:18>->->->. That’s vital.”"
It is <-<-<-<11.18>->->->. A row of bungalows in a round with a clump of larch tree in the middle.
"A whistle cut sharply across his words. Peter got onto his knees to look out the window, and Miss Fuller glared at him. Polly looked down at her watch: <-<-<-<11:19>->->->. The train. But the stationmaster had said it was always late."
"It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at <-<-<-<twenty past eleven>->->->, he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Island."
"From Balboa Island, he drove south to Laguna Beach. At <-<-<-<eleven-twenty>->->->, he parked his van across the street from the Hudston house."
"Harvey looked at the clock, which marked <-<-<-<twenty past eleven>->->->. ""Then I'll sleep here till three and catch the four o'clock freight. They let us men from the Fleet ride free as a rule."""
"The Swedish police did not exactly distinguish themselves. Palme was killed at <-<-<-<11.21 p.m.>->->->, but the order to watch the roads didn't go out until 12.50 and even then the police in patrol cars weren't told what they were looking for, and the airports were not closed until 1.05 a.m."
"Vero smiled. “I t-take that as approval. So let me summarize. On its present trajectory and speed, the Blade of Night will pass behind the moon between 11:13 and <-<-<-<11:22 p.m.>->->-> Jerusalem time on the night of the seventeenth of February. That’s four days away. It will be sufficiently close that the moon will fully cover the disk of the earth at 11:18. That’s vital.”"
"It began to rain again, so she sat there with the blinds open, staring at the drops on the glass.<br>The time was now <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes past eleven>->->->.<br>She knew only one thing with absolute certainty: she didn’t want to reach tomorrow. She stood up. She found a pen and a piece of paper.<br>It was, she decided, a very good time to die."
"At <-<-<-<11.22>->->-> he handed his ticket to a yawning guard and walked down a long flight of wooden steps to the car-park. A breeze lifted and dropped the leaves of a tree, and he thought of the girl with the blonde hair. His bicycle lay where he had left it."
"By the time the second lock had also admitted defeat with a click, things had still gone without a hitch. Quinten looked at his watch: <-<-<-<twenty-three minutes past eleven>->->->."
"<-<-<-<11:24 P.M.>->->-><br>Willem Voorst was at the controls of the Cessna as they powered through the Aegean night, their heading 210 as they closed rapidly on Andikythera. He was holding their altitude at five hundred meters, their airspeed just under a hundred knots, barely above stall."
"OK, Estelle, I will be at Nice Airport at <-<-<-<11.25 p.m.>->->-> on Saturday, BA: Could you send the driver?"
"To test the intensity of the light whose nature and cause he could not determine, he took out his watch to see if he could make out the figures on the dial. They were plainly visible, and the hands indicated the hour of <-<-<-<eleven o'clock and twenty-five minutes>->->->. At that moment the mysterious illumination suddenly flared to an intense, an almost blinding splendor…"
"Los Angeles. <-<-<-<11:26 p.m.>->->-> In a dark red room- the color of the walls is close to that of raw liver- is a tall woman dressed cartoonishly in too-tight silk shorts, her breasts pulled up and pressed forward by the yellow blouse tied beneath them."
At <-<-<-<11:27 P.M.>->->-> Jean-Pierre left quietly and returned to the solitude of his hotel room where he remained until 11 A.M. the next day. He phoned no one and did not use room service.
"He tells his old friend the train times and they settle on the 19.45 arriving at <-<-<-<23.27>->->->. ""I'll book us into the ultra-luxurious Francis Drake Lodge. Running water in several rooms. Have you got a mobile?"""
"Monday <-<-<-<11:28 P.M.>->->-><br>It was flawless. They dined in a Gothic, ivy-covered greenhouse in the garden of a maitre nineteenth-century inn where waiters scurried, the maitre d' hovered, and the wine steward nodded obsequiously every time he passed their table. It was even better than their first visit."
"With a sigh of relief that she had not missed the deadline, she crept between the sheets at <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes past eleven>->->-> and turned out the light at once."
"He came into their bedroom at just past <-<-<-<eleven-thirty>->->->. He’d taken his muddy shoes off downstairs, and was trying to be quiet, but he heard the rustle of bedclothes in the dark and knew she was awake."
"And so it was that around <-<-<-<half past eleven>->->->, I found myself riding down to the Village on the Fifth Avenue bus with the street address of Hobart and Blackwell in my pocket, written on a page from one of the monogrammed notepads Mrs Barbour kept by the telephone."
"“I will be a sonofa****h if he ain’t in here at <-<-<-<eleven-thirty at night>->->->, fartin’ around in the dark with a pair of scissors and a paper sack.”"
"He loaded the player and turned on the viewer, his knees popping again as he squatted to set the cue to <-<-<-<2330>->->->."
"He would catch the night bus for Casablanca, the one that left the beach at <-<-<-<half past eleven>->->->."
"The Picton boat was due to leave at <-<-<-<half-past eleven>->->->. It was a beautiful night, mild, starry, only when they got out of the cab and started to walk down the Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour, a faint wind blowing off the water ruffled under Fenella's hat, and she put up her hand to keep it on."
The ship's clock in the bar says <-<-<-<half past eleven>->->->. Half past eleven is opening time. The hands of the clock have stayed still at half past eleven for fifty years.
"It is <-<-<-<twenty-nine minutes to midnight>->->->. Dr. Narlikar's Nursing Home is running on a skeleton staff; there are many absentees, many employees who have preferred to celebrate the imminent birth of the nation, and will not assist tonight at the births of children."
"This is the evening. This is the night. It is New Year´s Eve. <-<-<-<In about twenty-eight minutes it will be midnight.>->->-> I still have twenty-eight minutes left. I have to recollect my thoughts. At twelve o´clock, I should be done thinking."
"And then it started to rain and I got wet and I started shivering because I was cold.<br>And then it was <-<-<-<11.32 p.m.>->->-> and I heard voices of people walking along the street.<br>And a voice said, ""I don't care whether you thought it was funny or not,"" and it was a lady's voice."
"<-<-<-<11:33 P.M.>->->-><br>The storm had cut visuals to a minimum, and the puddle hopper down there was still not responding."
"We are on Colaba Causeway now, just for a moment, to reveal that at <-<-<-<twenty-seven minutes to midnight>->->->, the police are hunting for a dangerous criminal. His name: Joseph D'Costa. The orderly is absent, has been absent for several days, from his work at the Nursing Home, from his room near the slaughterhouse, and from the life of a distraught virginal Mary"
"<-<-<-<Eleven thirty-four>->->->. We stand on the sidewalk in front of Jean's apartment on the Upper East Side. Her doorman eyes us warily and fills me with a nameless dread, his gaze piercing me from the lobby. A curtain of stars, miles of them, are scattered, glowing, across the sky and their multitude humbles me, which I have a hard time tolerating. She shrugs and nods after I say something about forms of anxiety. It's as if her mind is having a hard time communicating with her mouth, as if she is searching for a rational analysis of who I am, which is, of course, an impossibility: there ... is ... no ... key."
"Reacher retrieved his G36 from under the saloon bar window at <-<-<-<eleven thirty-four>->->-> precisely and set out to walk back on the road, which he figured would make the return trip faster."
He was behind the car on a motorbike for some miles and saw it draw in to park at the stones. This was about <-<-<-<eleven-thirty-five>->->-> on Friday. There was only one person in the car and the driver switched off the lights when he parked.
"Then at <-<-<-<eleven thirty-five>->->-> the door at the rear of the hall opened and a police sergeant and three constables entered, ushered by Bagot."
"Barbie phoned the police, and a car was dispatched from the station on Haverstock Hill at <-<-<-<11:35 p.m.>->->-> It arrived at the Berensons' house in just under three minutes."
Then Green knocks at the front door at <-<-<-<2336>->->-> - Gately has to Log the exact time and then it's his call whether to unlock the door.
"The last communication with the Teasdale had been at <-<-<-<eleven-thirty-seven P.M.>->->->, nearly a day and a half earlier, when the captain reported to the Coast Guard station at Duluth that he was altering the ship's course to seek shelter in the lee of the Apostle Islands. Because no other communication occurred, it was assumed that the ore carrier had made it safely and was waiting out the storm."
A Ford Focus with the number plate W341 UDG was seen parked close to the house <-<-<-<between eleven-thirty-five and eleven-forty>->->-> on the night she died.
"Jon and Randi reported the same.<br>""It's <-<-<-<twenty-two minutes to midnight>->->->,"" Randi added. ""So little time.""<br>They sped to the long, dark curving stairwell that seemed to drop into dark infinity."
"Time? Raith asked.<br>""<-<-<-<Eleven-thirty-nine>->->->, my lord,"" the bodyguard reported.<br>""Ah, good. Still time."" He walked over to a group of pillows in the far corner of the room, and I realized that they had been strewn around a little raised platform of stone."
"There's a whisper down the line at <-<-<-<11.39>->->-><br>When the Night Mail's ready to depart, Saying ""Skimble where is Skimble has he gone to hunt the thimble? We must find him or the train can't start."""
"It was about <-<-<-<twenty minutes to twelve>->->->. It was then I heard the lift. It's opposite Sister's suite - well, I expect you've seen it. I just heard the gentle clang of the doors and then a sort of purring sound as it went down."
"Grant noticed the time. ""It's <-<-<-<20 minutes until midnight>->->->. Who wants to help me hand out glasses and pour champagne?"""
"I went to the kitchen to select another bottle, deciding to reduce the next day’s alcohol intake to compensate. Then I saw the clock: <-<-<-<11:40 pm>->->->. I picked up the phone and ordered a taxi. With any luck it would arrive before the after-midnight tariff commenced."
"<-<-<-<Twenty minutes before midnight>->->->, before Oliver put an end to the festivities, she gave in to her impulse and texted her son, reminding him of their mutually agreed-upon curfew."
"We all have the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the <-<-<-<11:40>->->-> train tonight for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses."
"Once he was back behind the wheel, he checked his watch: <-<-<-<11:41>->->->. No reason he shouldn’t make it to Shillingford in a couple of hours, although he knew his father would be pacing up and down the driveway long before then."
"In a little while his mind cleared, but his head ached, arms ached, body ached. The phosphorescent figures on his watch attracted his attention. He peered at them. The time was <-<-<-<11:41>->->->. I remember...what do I remember?"
The front door opens. Her heart pounds. She looks at the time on the bottom right of her screen. <-<-<-<11.42>->->->.
At <-<-<-<11.42>->->-> then the signal's nearly due And the passengers are frantic to a man- Then Skimble will appear and he'll saunter to the rear:
"<-<-<-<Eleven-forty-three>->->->. In four minutes, give or take, Emma would die."
"The clock told him it was <-<-<-<eleven forty-three>->->-> and in that moment, in a flash of illumination, Mungo understood what the numbers at the end of Moscow Centre's messages were"
"At <-<-<-<eleven forty-four>->->-> last night somebody stabbed this girl in the neck with a kitchen knife and immediately thereafter plunged the same knife through her skull, where it remained."
"It was a <-<-<-<quarter to twelve>->->-> when the service was over. When he reached home, the bishop undressed and went to bed at once without even saying his prayers."
"It was <-<-<-<fifteen minutes to midnight>->->->, when the dead—according to Celia—threw off their coffin lids like so many blankets. Stop that, Matt told himself."
"Billy’s plan lasts until <-<-<-<quarter to midnight>->->->. He’s been watching some action movie in his underwear, and although the plot is simple—something about a guy seeking revenge on the men who killed his dog—Billy has lost the thread. He decides to call it a day."
"The church clocks chimed <-<-<-<three quarters past eleven>->->->, as two figures emerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man..."
"We struck the tow-path at length, and that made us happy because prior to this we had not been sure whether we were walking towards the river or away from it, and when you are tired and want to go to bed, uncertainties like that worry you. We passed Shiplake as the clock was striking the <-<-<-<quarter to twelve>->->-> and then George said thoughtfully: ""You don't happen to remember which of the islands it was, do you?"""
"In the Kismet Lounge, Mr. Early sees suddenly to his horror it's <-<-<-<11:46 p.m.>->->-> He's been in this place far longer than he'd planned, and he's had more to drink than he'd planned. Shame! What if, back at the E-Z, his little girl is crying piteously for him?"
"Because the two curses that have struck here in Chicago arrived at eleven forty-seven in the morning, and damned close to that last night. Add two hours to the deaths in California to account for the difference in time zones. The curse was sent at the same time. <-<-<-<Thirteen minutes before noon or midnight>->->->."
"If he had glanced at his watch, he would have seen that it was <-<-<-<thirteen minutes to midnight>->->->. And if he had been interested in what was going on, he would have heard the voices and bawling of terrified men."
"It was <-<-<-<near midnight>->->->.<br>Torvik took the doll which had been left on the couch in the study, after first having mended its broken foot."
"It was <-<-<-<near midnight>->->-> when she left the Palace in a clothes-hamper borne by two porters, covered with her own soiled smocks and petticoats which were supposedly being carried to the laundress."
Littell arranged a private charter. He told the pilot to fly balls-to-the-wall. The little two-seater rattled and shook-Kemper couldn't believe it. It was <-<-<-<11.48 pm>->->->. They were thirty-six hours short of GO.
"Tom shrugged. He pushed his pinkish ruffled sleeve back, and saw that it was <-<-<-<eleven minutes to midnight>->->->. Tom finished his coffee."
"The clock on the wall read <-<-<-<ten to midnight>->->->. Cork wanted to turn the hands back, do it all differently, be in all the right places at all the right times. He wanted a second chance at the last few days. The last few years."
"Oh, Mr. MacLear, he said jocularly, ""I am glad you have just managed to escape breaking the Sabbath! You have had a close shave! It <-<-<-<wants ten minutes, hardly more, to the awful midnight hour>->->->!"""
"At <-<-<-<11.50 pm>->->->, I got up extremely quietly, took my things from under the bed, and opened the door one millimeter at a time, so it wouldn't make any noise."
Virginia checked her watch: <-<-<-<nine minutes to twelve>->->->. She had kept her side of the bargain. She pressed the doorbell and waited until she saw a light on the third floor go on.
"Due at Waterloo at <-<-<-<eleven-fifty-one>->->->, panted Smith. ""That gives us thirty-nine minutes to get to the other side of the river and reach his hotel."""
"And then the VCR broke.<br>I heard the wheels spin, then whine, then screech, then stop. I hit “eject” and nothing happened. I poked at all the buttons. I unplugged and replugged the machine. I picked it up and shook it. I banged on it with the butt of my hand, then a shoe. Nothing was working. Outside, it was dark. My phone said it was January 6, <-<-<-<11:52 P.M.>->->->"
"It was <-<-<-<eight minutes to midnight>->->->. Just nice time, I said to myself. Indoors, everything was quiet and in darkness. Splendid. I went to the bar and fetched a tumbler, a siphon of soda and a bottle of Glen Grant, took a weak drink and a pill, and settled down in the public dining-room to wait the remaining two minutes."
"“It most certainly is, my darling. I’m just returning the vases.” She looked again at her watch. “I think you’ll find it’s <-<-<-<seven minutes to midnight>->->->, so I’ve kept my side of the bargain.”"
"It was <-<-<-<near midnight>->->->.<br>Torvik took the doll which had been left on the couch in the study, after first having mended its broken foot."
"It was <-<-<-<near midnight>->->-> when she left the Palace in a clothes-hamper borne by two porters, covered with her own soiled smocks and petticoats which were supposedly being carried to the laundress."
"It was <-<-<-<nearing midnight>->->-> and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind."
"<-<-<-<Midnight is approaching>->->->, and while the peak of activity has passed, the basal metabolism that maintains life continues undiminished, producing the basso continuo of the city's moan, a monotonous sound that neither rises or falls but is pregnant with foreboding."
"His watch read <-<-<-<11.54 pm>->->-> Eastern Standard Time. Already it was nearly 6.00 am in Rome. He had left a city frozen by a harsh January storm, after a bleak, wet Christmas season."
"The band began playing “Auld Lang Syne.”<br>“<-<-<-<Eleven fifty-five>->->->,” she said, glancing at the gold watch on her pendant. “I really like ‘Auld Lang Syne.’ How about you?”"
"As Ness arrives at Union Station, the giant clock tells us it is <-<-<-<five minutes to midnight>->->->. This is significant, because humans consider midnight a time when bad things happen. Midnight is the Ides of March of the hours in the day! ""Five minutes to midnight"" is therefore excellent foreshadowing. After all, it is almost directly equivalent to ""Five minutes to very bad things happening""."
"I am going to lock you in. It is- he consulted his watch, ""<-<-<-<five minutes to midnight>->->->. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck."""
"It wanted <-<-<-<five minutes to twelve>->->->, when the premonitory symptoms of the working of the laudanum first showed themselves to me. At this time, no unpractised eyes would have detected any change in him. But, as the minutes of the new morning wore away, the swiftly-subtle progress of the influence began to show itself more plainly. The sublime intoxication of opium gleamed in his eyes; the dew of a stealthy perspiration began to glisten on his face. In five minutes more, the talk which he still kept up with me, failed in coherence."
"The human race is at the end of the line, the doomsday clock ticks on. It's stopped for a decade at <-<-<-<four minutes to midnight>->->->, but there the hands still stand. Any minute now they'll begin to move again."
It said <-<-<-<three minutes to midnight>->->->. That didn't seem so very late in the mood I was in. I put on my dressing-gown and took my pocket torch with me and went to Sally's room.
"<-<-<-<Eleven fifty-seven>->->->, he said. Wells nodded. By the old woman's calendar I've got three more minutes."
"You got to let the world go to hell in its own way, Gard, <-<-<-<two minutes to midnight>->->-> or not."
"Humans emerge <-<-<-<one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight>->->->. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant."
"<-<-<-<At a minute to midnight>->->->, Roquenton was holding his wife's hand and giving her some last words of advice. On the stroke of midnight, she felt her companion's hand melt away inside her own."
Chigurgh rose and picked up the empty casing off the rug and blew into it and put it in his pocket and looked at his watch. The <-<-<-<new day was still a minute away>->->->.
